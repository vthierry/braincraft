	abstract = {The research focuses on integrating collaborative problem posing and solving (CPPS) activity into mathematics learning practice with authentic contextual support. We designed a ubiquitous learning application called “U-Decimal” to facilitate CPPS activity supporting decimal learning. The application facilitated the CPPS activity in three ways: designing questions in an authentic context, answering questions designed by students and teachers, and peer assessment. The study aimed to investigate the effect of student’s learning behaviors in CPPS activity supported by U-Decimal on their decimal learning achievement. In total, 54 fourth graders from two different classes were engaged in the experiment. The experimental group completed CPPS activity using U-Decimal installed on tablet PCs, whereas the control group followed traditional CPPS activity with a paper-based approach. The results highlighted three main findings. First, the experimental students scored significantly higher on the post-test than the control students. Second, this study found the contributing functional aspects (i.e., picture-taking function, multimedia-text and voice explanation, and peer assessment) and behavioral factors that predict learning achievement (i.e., quality of multiple-choice question design, quality of comment, and explaining answer using multimedia-text and voice explanation). Most importantly, our findings showed that U-Decimal is useful in supporting decimal learning achievement.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present an agenda for the research directions we recommend in addressing the issues of realizing and evaluating communication in CPS instruments. We outline our ideas on potential ways to improve (1) generalizability in Human–Human assessment tools and ecological validity in Human–Agent ones; (2) flexible and convenient use of restricted communication options; and (3) an evaluation system of both Human–Human and Human-Agent instruments. Furthermore, in order to demonstrate possible routes for realizing some of our suggestions, we provide examples through an introduction of the features of our own CPS instrument. It is a Human–Human pre-version of a future Human–Agent instrument and a promising diagnostic and research tool in its own right, as well as the first example of transforming the so-called MicroDYN approach so that it is suitable for Human–Human collaboration. We offer new alternatives for communication in addition to pre-defined messages within the test, which are also suitable for automated coding. For example, participants can send or request visual information in addition to verbal messages. As regards evaluation as a hybrid solution, not only are the pre-defined messages proposed as indicators of different CPS skills, but so are a number of behavioural patterns.},

	abstract = {Interest in understanding regulation in the context of collaborative learning has increased in the past decade. Existing studies have investigated how regulated learning evolves in collaborative learning by focusing on external behaviors, and how different types and strategies of regulation are effective in promoting collaborative learning. Due to the cyclical and dynamic characteristics of regulation, there is a need for new methods that can trace the dynamic emergence of regulatory processes in diver collaborative learning contexts, so as to provide some insight into effective learning design. In the context of 45 student teachers participating in multi-layered online collaborative activities, this study investigated their regulatory patterns during various stages of online collaborative learning activities over an eight-week semester via content analysis and epistemic network analysis (ENA). Quantitative analyses indicated that student teachers demonstrated active social aspects of regulation and had many regulatory behaviors in content monitoring in the designed online collaborative learning activities. Through identifying and comparing the regulatory patterns of the high-performing group and the low-performing group across the stages of learning activities, the results showed that the group demonstrating ample regulatory patterns in “content monitoring”, “evaluating”, and “social emotional regulatory behavior” performed better on the collective score of group product. Furthermore, the analysis elucidated how groups regulated their collaboration variously in different stages of online learning activities. Suggestions about regulated learning at both cognitive and social emotional aspects are provided to teachers and learning designers for designing and implementing online collaborative learning activities.},

	abstract = {This article discusses the relatively new concept of ludification with the attempt of laying the theoretical groundwork for further studies. Although ludification ties in with both gamification and the concept and practice of transmedia it possesses unique characteristics and qualities of its own, primarily evolving around games and playful ways of structuring stories. The focus point is how traditional media such as tv-series and movies incorporate game-like traits and structures into their narrative structure. This concerns both the narrative structures that users can and cannot interact with. Among other things, we consider a deep understanding of ludification vital for the more practically oriented approach to learning through (serious) games. Thus, this paper serves as a prolegomenon to the interpretation of works of ludification, as well as to the diverse field of deploying gamified material in didactical and pedagogical context. In addition to the conceptual groundwork for understanding ludification and how it manifests itself we propose an analytical method for unearthing the traits and structures of ludification: we have coined this method the ludo-interpretation. Furthermore, this article discusses the merits and shortcomings of ludification and the ludo-interpretation in the final section where we deploy a Popperian inspired three-levelled falsification and refutation technique.},

	abstract = {Recent voices in creativity research emphasize the vital role that processes of active engagement and interaction play. These distributed, interactivity-based, and ecological accounts critique the reduction of creativity to mental mechanisms and eschew the methodological individualism that underlies this view. Instead, they elevate socio-material couplings to a genuine causal mechanism, hereby explaining why others “are good to be creative with” beyond mutual inspiration or mere constraints on creativity. With improvised dance duets as our example, we introduce a micro-analysis that unpacks these mechanisms from a first-person viewpoint: We describe how the embodied communication at the sub-second scale, a continuous “give and take” between dancers, mediates the co-creation process and how reciprocal micro-actions cumulate into more complex creative effects. Secondly, we distinguish convergent and divergent co-creation dynamics, degrees of playful exploration vs. adaptive pressures, and degrees of individual creative autonomy. Thirdly, we argue that the mix of external constraints, joint exploration, and individual ideation provides a fertile mechanism for co-creation. Finally, we discuss forms of individual creative vision that respect and exploit the dynamic ecology, which can manifest in immediate micro-inspirations, but also in subtle modulations of ongoing process, and in “cultivating” the wider system in ways that benefit novelty.},

Although the conditional relationship between creative idea generation and implementation has frequently been recognized, there have been few studies of the moderating factors that facilitate converting creative ideas into tangible innovations. To fill this research gap, we explore whether leader performance-prove goal orientation facilitates the implementation of creative ideas at the team level. Furthermore, we investigate the mediating role of leader comprehensive boundary-spanning strategy in the moderating effect of leader performance-prove goal orientation. From an analysis of data from 83 new product development (NPD) teams, we find the following: (1) Leader performance-prove goal orientation positively moderates the relationship between idea generation and implementation. (2) Leader ambassadorial activities and task coordination both positively moderate the relationship between idea generation and implementation. (3) The moderating role of leader performance-prove goal orientation is mediated by leader ambassadorial activities. Our findings have theoretical and practical implications for innovation management in NPD teams.},

	abstract = {Background Collaborative computer simulations are available on some online platforms which support students at distributed locations to synchronously collaborate on the simulations to learn sciences. However, how students collaborate with each other in collaborative simulations is not clear. Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate whether functional interdependency would influence learning. Methods Two collaborative learning models with different functional interdependencies were examined (the synchronous model and the distributed accountability model). Multiple data sources obtained from 64 students were collected and analyzed. We discuss the collaborative learning with two levels of factors: the individual-level factors (i.e., individual perceptions of teamwork quality, visual attention and learning performance before and after a simulation activity) and the pair-level factors (i.e., discourse data and joint attention). Given that the pair-level factors in the collaborative learning environment may affect the individual-level factors, we further discuss the interactions of the two levels of factors in different collaborative learning models with hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analysis. Results and Conclusions The analytical results of the individual-level factors found participants in the distributed accountability model demonstrated more frequent and longer attention to the learning activity. Furthermore, the results indicated that the two simulation learning activities would enhance the participants' learning performance except in Q2. For the pair-level factors, the results demonstrated that the participants in the distributed accountability model showed more active discourse segments but similar joint attention patterns in the learning activity. The results of the HLM analysis indicated that the students in the distributed accountability model had to collaborate with their partners through more constructive dialogue, and focused on the same areas of interest to enhance their learning performance, as the complexity of the distributed accountability design was implemented in a simulation learning activity. Major takeaways We found that the increase of functional interdependency cannot guarantee students' learning effect in collaborative learning and may hinder the communication that is needed during collaboration. Researcher may need to consider other collaboration tools to enhance the reciprocal reflection.},

However, the effects of the ratio of mobile device-based VMs to students and external scripts (a guiding structure for prompting group process) provision on group interaction has not been detailed. Objectives This study proposed four different technology affordance conditions for collaborative inquiry learning: 1:1 device-student ratio (one tablet per student) with external scripts, 1:m ratio (one tablet per group) with external scripts, 1:1 ratio without external scripts, and 1:m ratio without external scripts. The purpose of this study is to identify the effect of technology affordances on group behavioural patterns during collaborative inquiry learning. Methods The research participants were 21 fifth-grade students from 4 classes (totalling 130 students) in a public elementary school. Students' collaborative inquiry behavioural patterns were video-recorded during three themed inquiry activities. To identify the behavioural patterns of groups, this study developed an action-oriented coding scheme for collaborative inquiry learning emphasizing and coded student actions during cooperation. Through lag sequential analysis and dialog content analysis, the behavioural transition modes of groups were obtained. Results The results show that device-student ratios and external scripts affect behavioural patterns through resource coordination, information interaction, collaborative atmosphere, and task awareness. Implications In mobile device-support collaborative inquiry learning, the 1:m device-student ratio yielded more exchanges to test and apply new constructions than that of the 1:1 ratio. External scripts were more applicable to the 1:m condition than to the 1:1 condition.},

Results and Conclusions The study showed that both social-comparison coopetition and zero-sum real-time reward coopetition can be more effective than zero-sum delayed reward coopetition in teaching knowledge and skills in robotics education. Social comparison coopetition turned out to have a larger effect on affective outcome than the zero-sum delayed reward coopetition. Implications Social comparison coopetition seems to be a more advantages method for both cognitive and affective learning. However, more research is needed to confirm the difference in effectiveness between the three models of coopetition.},

For group learning, students were grouped into two different settings on the basis of their learning perspectives derived from class notes and their personality types. In the present study, we used a novel algorithm based on k modes clustering. Grouping indeed improved students’ performance, particularly, the heterogeneous groups performed better than the homogenous groups.

	abstract = {This study empirically investigates diffusion-based centralities as depictions of student role-based behavior in information exchange, uptake and argumentation, and as consistent indicators of student success in computer-supported collaborative learning. The analysis is based on a large dataset of 69 courses (n = 3,277 students) with 97,173 total interactions (of which 8,818 were manually coded). We examined the relationship between students’ diffusion-based centralities and a coded representation of their interactions in order to investigate the extent to which diffusion-based centralities are able to adequately capture information exchange and uptake processes. We performed a meta-analysis to pool the correlation coefficients between centralities and measures of academic achievement across all courses while considering the sample size of each course. Lastly, from a cluster analysis using students’ diffusion-based centralities aimed at discovering student role-taking within interactions, we investigated the validity of the discovered roles using the coded data. There was a statistically significant positive correlation that ranged from moderate to strong between diffusion-based centralities and the frequency of information sharing and argumentation utterances, confirming that diffusion-based centralities capture important aspects of information exchange and uptake. The results of the meta-analysis showed that diffusion-based centralities had the highest and most consistent combined correlation coefficients with academic achievement as well as the highest predictive intervals, thus demonstrating their advantage over traditional centrality measures. Characterizations of student roles based on diffusion centralities were validated using qualitative methods and were found to meaningfully relate to academic performance. Diffusion-based centralities are feasible to calculate, implement and interpret, while offering a viable solution that can be deployed at any scale to monitor students’ productive discussions and academic success.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, privacy education plays an important role in teenagers’ lives. Since this domain is strongly linked to their social life, it is preferable to provide a collaborative learning environment that teaches privacy, and at the same time, allows students to share knowledge, to interact with each other, to solve quizzes collaboratively and to discuss privacy issues and situations. To this end, we propose “Teens-online”, a collaborative e-learning platform for privacy awareness. The curriculum provided in this platform is based on the International Competency Framework on Privacy Education. Moreover, the proposed platform is equipped with a partner-matching mechanism based on matching game theory. This mechanism guarantees a stable student-student matching according to the student’s need (behavior and/or knowledge). Thus, mutual benefits will be attained by largely minimizing the chances of cooperating with incompatible students. Experimental results show that the average utility obtained by applying the proposed algorithm is much higher than the average utility obtained using other matching mechanisms. The results suggest that by adopting the proposed approach, each student can be paired with their optimal partners, which in turn can help them to engage more in learning activities.},

	abstract = {Immersive virtual environments hold unexplored potential to scaffold and stimulate learning in multiple ways for the purpose of increasing potential learning gains. Yet, the number of implementations in educational settings remains very limited. One reason for limited implementation of immersive virtual environment applications may be a lack of recommendations for their effective design. Building on an extensive theoretical framework, this paper provides such recommendations, specific to immersive educational settings. The recommendations are divided into strategies to optimize cognitive load, foster collaborative learning, leverage platform-specific affordances, mitigate platform-specific limitations and to obtain additional benefits. We illustrate the implementation of these recommendations using a novel collaborative virtual reality environment shown to yield learning gains in two prior studies. Moreover, we detail how a non-invasive and cost-effective feature of automated performance analysis can monitor learning gains in collaborative virtual reality environments. The recommendations based on the example of a collaborative virtual reality environment pave the way for more such implementations to maximize benefits for learners and educators alike.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine Primary school students’ perceptions towards self-directed learning (SDL) and Collaborative learning (CL) with and without the integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in English writing lessons in Singapore. There were 408 students participated in this study voluntarily. The results showed that the participants’ perceptions for SDL and CL were positive in both control and ICT-enhanced experimental groups, with means ranged from 3.73 to 3.90 out of a 5-point Likert scale. Both groups’ perceptions for SDL with technology and CL with technology were consistent lower than without technology, ranged from 2.98 to 3.72. MANCOVA was used to compare the difference in perceptions between the control and the experimental groups. The results showed that there were significant differences between the two groups in the perceptions of SDL with technology and CL with technology. The experimental group used a variety of technology tools, such as tablets, online writing assistant tools and online notice boards to facilitate their narrative writings during the 5-week intervention. They have opportunities to develop self-direct learning skills through the online writing assistant tool, they practiced collaborative learning skills through sharing their narratives and providing constructive peer feedback on online notice boards. The results indicated that students in the ICT-enhanced experimental group perceived significantly more positive perceptions towards both SDL with technology and CL with technology. As the Covid-19 pandemic continues to sweep across the world, learning activities conducted in this study could be applicable to blended or online English lessons to facilitate the development of students’ Self-directed learning and Collaborative learning skills through the ICT-enhanced learning activities. Some recommendations will be discussed in the paper.},

It does so through consideration of five reports in this Special Issue that address the integration challenge. Various themes are extracted and proposed as important to the field. These include the layered nature of self-regulation (meta-metacognition) and the layered nature of group awareness (trait-state-action). The theatre metaphor implied by the term ‘collaboration script’ is taken seriously here and is elaborated. It is shown to afford an extended and richer conceptualisation of scripted collaborations, developing the significance of direction, production, and audience. The features characterising this model of collaboration-as-performance reinforce an imperative for locating episodes of scripted collaboration within the broader eco-system of classroom practice.},

In this mixed methods, sequential explanatory design data were collected through achievement test, WIHIC questionnaire, and in-depth interviews. There was a significant difference between the academic achievement of students and also their perception of classroom environment in the experimental and control groups in favor of CL. The students’ experience indicated that CL not only creates a secure environment and enhances the deep learning and motivational process, but also increases instructor support and provides equal opportunities for student involvement in the patient education classroom. The findings of this study illuminated the role of social interdependence theory played in helping students connected with each other to promote learning.

Previous studies suggest students can benefit from a collaboration script to enhance socially shared regulation of TOR. The collaboration script elicits discussions about task perception, strategy selection, and strategy reflection. This study aimed to examine the depth and socially sharedness of metacognitive regulation when working with a collaboration script among 44 prevocational secondary school students working in groups of four. In addition, we examined the consequent improvement of individual task representation, strategy selection, and strategy reflection after working with the script. The analysis of group discussions indicated that the collaboration script facilitated mainly low-level metacognitive regulation of TOR. However, after working with the script, students did improve their ability to determine a correct representation of a high-level task and to reflect on the most appropriate reading strategy for these tasks. Hence, we concluded that the ‘Y-read?’ collaboration script did elicit shared regulation during TOR.},

	abstract = {In recent years, how students’ engagement can be developed in flipped classroom (FC) model has become a critical issue addressed in an educational context. Evidence suggests that students’ behavioral, cognitive, and emotional engagement may decrease in FC in time. It is thought that social networking sites (SNS) can contribute to this problem in FC. Since it is believed that students will show greater interest in discussions and knowledge exchange about the course, supporting courses with SNS is significant in terms of providing students with a social learning environment, it is assumed that students’ role of sociability, sense of community, and course satisfaction will increase, thereby promoting students’ engagement in those courses supported by SNS. This assumption appears in the literature as a gap that needs to be explored. In this sense, the purpose of this current research is to examine perceived sociability, sense of community, and student satisfaction and to determine how these variables predict behavioral, cognitive, and emotional engagement of students in FC supported by a virtual learning community. A total of 219 university students at a state university in Turkey. The research was carried out in the Computing I course conducted according to the FC model, and it was supported by the virtual learning community created on Facebook. Knowledge sharing and discussions about the course were made in Facebook groups. The data draws on students’ responses via three self-report instruments: satisfaction scale, students’ engagement scale, perceived sociability scale, and sense of community scale. Stepwise multiple linear regression was conducted for the data analysis. The findings indicate that students’ engagement in FC applications supported by the Facebook-based virtual learning community is high. Regarding sub-dimensions, students’ behavioral and emotional engagement scores are high, while cognitive engagement is moderate. Additionally, perceived sociability, sense of community, and satisfaction are significant predictors of students’ engagement. Several implications and future research recommendations are discussed.},

The present work aims to fill the gap in the existing literature by showcasing the power of learning analytics methods to reveal and represent students' behavior when participating in a computer-supported educational escape room. Specifically, we make use of sequence mining methods to analyze the temporal and sequential aspects of the activities carried out by students during these novel educational games. We further use clustering to identify different player profiles according to the sequential unfolding of students' actions and analyze how these profiles relate to knowledge acquisition. Our results show that students' behavior differed significantly in their use of hints in the escape room and resulted in differences in their knowledge acquisition levels.},

Most CSCL research activities concerned with group awareness aim at modifying learners' awareness using so-called group awareness tools. However, there are much less attempts to measure group awareness and to conceptualize its formation. Thus, building on existing group awareness research, this article derives a conceptualization with six defining aspects of group awareness: (1) group awareness is cognitive, (2) group awareness is conscious, (3) group awareness is current, (4) group awareness is individual, (5) group awareness is social, and (6) group awareness is perceived as valid. Additionally, while it is often assumed that group awareness builds on self-regulatory skills, its role in regulating behavior and cognition within a social context is seldom explored. Thus, this article aims at defining and analyzing the concept of group awareness, specifying its relation to regulatory processes, and sketching possible research paths whilst building on, complementing, and informing tool-driven research.},

Earlier research on user requirements for such games have identified seven different activity types that have proven to initiate social interaction and capture real life exchanges for meaningful play-based social experiences. Yet, current understanding on what makes these games successful in such endeavours is still insufficient. This study furthers current understanding on the effects of location-based games for social interaction in local communities: it studies the forms of social interaction that the previously identified seven types of game activities elicit by analysing the nature and types of the exchanges they trigger. Based on this analysis, a design framework is proposed to 1) analyse existing location-based games and describe the forms of social interaction they trigger, and 2) help practitioners design new game activities that target specific forms of social interaction. This contributes to the enhancement of current understanding on the impact that these games can have in local communities, and on the way they can be better designed and used to promote social exchanges that are desired by players.},

Ratings of creative performance (fluency and originality), hemodynamic inter-brain synchronization, and lag sequential analysis were compared among the three groups. The results showed that groups comprising two highly motivated members conducted an efficient communication mode and achieved the best creative performance. Contrastingly, groups composed of one high- and one low-motivation member demonstrated the closest interpersonal interaction among members.

	abstract = {During the pandemic, students have been regularly engaged in what I call real time learning through chat and polling exercises. This is an exciting development, but one that also carries the risk of being poorly implemented and not achieving its intended learning outcomes. Four real time teaching methods are presented in this article for consideration by instructors. These methods activate the early stages of the learning process as students encounter and reflect on concepts, puzzles and cases. The resulting level of student engagement acts as a stepping-stone towards higher-level thinking. The four methods are: reproducing questions from polling organizations; asking prediction-oriented questions; repeating polls several weeks later; and, placing more attention on text-based entry. Teaching innovation here represents small changes in the classroom that can be adopted by a wide number of instructors, carrying discernible impacts on student learning. The data from this study suggest that well-designed use of the chat box is the most effective of the four teaching methods examined. The lessons derived from real time learning in social science courses, especially how students recognize the learning opportunities afforded by short writing activities, can be applied in other disciplines.Statement on Human Ethics This study was deemed by the university's human ethics committee as not requiring human ethics approval. While preparing this manuscript, the instructor took the following steps: the instructor set out to reflect and report on the students' work after the course was completed.the questionnaire was administered at the end of semester. The students' participation in the survey did not count towards their grade in the class and there were no repercussions for those who did not participate.

	abstract = {As the field of computer science (CS) is gaining increased attention, the need for qualified teachers is rapidly growing. Yet little is still known about the design features, implementation, and outcomes of professional development programs in computing. The purpose of this study is threefold: (a) examine a CS professional development program built around high-quality design features reported in the research literature, (b) investigate the impact of the program on participating teachers’ learning and classroom practice, and (c) identify specific design features that facilitated changes in teacher learning and practice. The study employed a mixed-methods design. Data were collected from multiple sources including, pre and post survey data on teacher knowledge of CS content, pedagogy, and technology (N = 94), as well as interviews and classroom implementation data from eight case study participants. Findings from this work indicated that participants reported improvements in their knowledge of CS content, pedagogy, and technology. They also applied new learning into their practice, though implementation varied among participants. Responding on the value of the professional development design features, teachers noted the importance of focusing on CS content knowledge as well as opportunities to engage with pedagogical practices for teaching computing. Findings also indicated the important role of contextualized follow-up classroom support in the implementation of new learning into practice. These findings have implications for the design of professional development programs grounded in best practices with the potential to support broad efforts intended to prepare teachers with the knowledge and skills needed to deliver CS education.},

The results show no differences according to the educational stage to perceive adequate skills to learn programming and robotics, although, by area, the teachers of STEAM are considered more capable than the rest. Regarding the introduction of these resources in the classroom, there are no differences according to educational stage. As for differences by area, STEAM teachers stand out, followed by generalist teachers at lower levels (kindergarten and basic school), while there is greater reluctance among teachers of non-STEM areas at higher levels (high school and university and others). It is concluded that the initial perception is similar for teachers of different stages, and with differences with respect to the area, having interesting repercussions on the design of courses.},

This paper presented a case study on how students learned CT skills through a coding game via two approaches: one using collaborative learning (through cognitive apprenticeship) and the other through individual learning. The quasi-experimental design was used in two classes (24 students in each class) and was divided into using one of the two approaches. Relevant data were collected through pre- and post-tests based on the E-game CT test. The research results indicated: (1) Both collaborative learning (through cognitive apprenticeship) and individual learning effectively enhanced the learning effects of students’ development for CT skills in an E-game coding education platform; (2) In collaborative learning (through cognitive apprenticeship), students in lower-scoring groups could enhance their CT skills more effectively than those in higher-scoring groups; (3) For those students who fell in the two lower-scoring groups, those in collaborative learning (through cognitive apprenticeship) had higher significant learning effects than those in individual learning; (4) Students with lower scores who programmed with a higher-scoring partner learned more than when they programmed alone. Overall, this study showed that the use of an E-game learning platform enabled the learning process of CT to become more interesting and challenging for students.},

	abstract = {Intercreativity is a phenomenon with significant social, cultural and educational implications in the postdigital era. Its meaning refers to the fact of solving problems and making a collective production. However –in a historical and philosophical context that has led to the rise and importance of knowledge production– intercreativity is a phenomenon insufficiently analysed. Searching a variety of interdisciplinary databases, this paper summarises a systematic review conducted among 49 scientific publications that mentioned the term intercreativity and associated it to other theoretical concepts. The period of time covered was 2002–2021 and peer-review papers in Spanish and English languages were collected following the PRISMA checklist and flow diagram. The results suggest that applying intercreative strategies in education is crucial in a social context where participation and communication are essential and in which education moves to digital spaces that are by nature open and cooperative. Not restricted only to digital environments, the nature of these spaces tends to support the intercreative practices as well as the values derived from it. Intercreativity in education entails an intersubjective production of knowledge, collaborative strategies and the development of critical pedagogies that position digital education as a vehicle for social transformation towards solidarity and community.},

Our results indicate a positive and significant effect on problem-solving performance among study participants with seven or more years of game play experience, and positive feelings toward game learning as reflected in negatively skewed self-regulated learning scores. We also found that the “representation and formulation” stage served as a significant performance predictor, the “planning and execution” and “monitoring and reflection” stages were significant predictors of dynamic/technical problems, and the “exploring and understanding” stage was a predictor for static/non-technical problems. Our data indicate significant differences in problem-solving cognitive processes across ranges of contexts and characteristics.

	abstract = {Critical reading is required for information literacy in the 21st century. However, how students read and process conflicting information regarding controversial issues is still not clear. Using eye-tracking technology, this exploratory study aimed to identify visual behavior patterns that characterized critical reading strategies when students processed conflicting information about socio-scientific issues, and to examine relationships among students' visual behavior, reading strategies, and reading task outcomes. Forty-eight undergraduate and graduate students participated and read conflicting texts about food-science issues. The conflicting texts were presented in the traditional Chinese language. Participants' eye movements were tracked during the entire reading process and their self-reported critical reading strategies, recall, and opinions on the issues were collected right after reading. Pearson's correlation analyses, lag sequential analyses, and content analyses were used to analyze the data. Results showed that participants with higher scores on self-reported critical reading strategies tended to pay more attention to reasoning information in conflicting reports and to include more judgments in their responses. Further, two significant visual behavior patterns were identified for critical reading: (1) after a pause for thinking or resting, critical readers' visual attention shifted directly back to reasoning information; and (2) critical readers' visual attention shifted between reasoning and data information. These two visual behavior patterns suggested that data inspection is important for critical reasoning about conflicting information. This study provided evidence for the applicability of eye-tracking technology in assessing critical reading strategies and relationships between eye-tracking data and self-reported critical reading strategies. Findings can contribute to the future design of adaptive learning systems and teaching of critical reading strategies.},

Experts assessed the effectiveness of the pilot program over two semesters and revised the curriculum for formal program implementation in the following two semesters. The efficacy of teaching and learning was evaluated using diverse data collected through student self-evaluation charts, checklists for basic modeling exercises (using software), evaluation charts, and daily teacher logs. The findings revealed that computer-aided drawing is a powerful tool that can help students understand concepts, offer them the opportunity to showcase their creativity, and spark their motivation to learn.

	abstract = {Technological advancements have improved the capabilities of pedagogical agents to communicate with students. However, an increased use of pedagogical agents in learning environments calls for a deeper understanding of student–agent communication to assess the effectiveness of pedagogical agents in learning. This study is a two-phase systematic review of scientific papers on pedagogical agent communication research published between 2010 and 2020, including review papers and original research papers. In the first phase, this study analyses literature reviews and meta-analyses to find the status and research gaps. The findings indicate that pedagogical agents' characteristics and impact on learning have been reviewed, but pedagogical agent communication and its relation to learning have not. In the second phase, the empirical studies of pedagogical agent communication are reviewed and classified into three categories that describe how pedagogical agent communication facilitates students' learning through (1) students' intrapersonal communication processes, (2) interpersonal communication between students and a pedagogical agent, and (3) by facilitating learning in a group. The findings show that pedagogical agent communication can enhance learning through intrapersonal communication of motivation, self-regulation, self-efficacy, and metacognition. At the interpersonal level, pedagogical agents aim to scaffold learning by giving feedback, prompts, and hints from learning processes and learning results. Pedagogical agents also support learning in a group by facilitating discussions and directing students' collaboration. Despite rapid technological advancements, pedagogical agents are not on the level to communicate fluently and human-like, which is likely to reduce their effectiveness and usability in learning. The review concludes that pedagogical agents’ communication needs to be developed toward adaptive, adequate, relational, and logical communication, which requires a multidisciplinary theoretical approach, the use of artificial intelligence, affective computing, and psychometric assessments. Recommendations for future research addressing the gaps identified in this systematic review are discussed.},

This article documents these historical changes and contends that the decline in play has contributed to the rise in the psychopathology of young people. Play functions as the major means by which children (1) develop intrinsic interests and competencies; (2) learn how to make decisions, solve problems, exert self-control, and follow rules; (3) learn to regulate their emotions; (4) make friends and learn to get along with others as equals; and (5) experience joy.

Two tasks were used: the alternative uses task, which measures divergent thinking, and the creative mental synthesis task, which measure the ability to create objects belonging to specific categories. Results showed that the peaking of performances at both tasks is reached before 40 years, and declines thereafter. The analysis also showed that divergent thinking and creative objects production stabilize after 40 years and decline after 70 years, especially the ability to create objects. These results reveal that creative thinking might be preserved across years.},

	abstract = {Parent involvement in and engagement with children’s learning has been shown to strongly influence student achievement, engagement, motivation and school completion. However, parent involvement decreases once students reach middle school, as subject content gets harder, the number of teachers increases, and students are less likely to share their homework and learning with parents. To this end, the flipped learning (FL) approach has received growing attention, with evidence of improved higher order thinking and collaborative skills and increased transparency for parents. This paper explores school leader, parent, student and teacher perceptions of the FL approach, through the lens of a 1-year case study of two rural South Australian schools, in order to uncover how the approach affects parent engagement. Findings reveal that, whilst stakeholders feel that the flipped approach is beneficial for absent students, to reinforce content and increase student responsibility, it has not yet improved transparency for parents, with a disconnect between what schools think parents know and are engaging in, and the actual level of parent engagement in student learning. Recommendations for schools implementing the FL approach are provided against a bioecological model, adapted for this study.},

Some methods focus on learning to code while others take a creative programming approach (Resnick \& Rusk, 2020). This study looks at creative programming as an opportunity for students to develop their reasoning skills. Drawing from both mathematics teaching and creative programming practices, we identify the elements of informatics thinking and use them to analyze the behaviour of students during a programming task in educational robotics. We also apply certain conceptual tools from both the field of mathematics teaching and the framework of informatics thinking in the course of our study. Creative programming practices provide six factors for analyzing how the students approached situational problems, framed the problems, learned the code, and developed the programs. From a didactics perspective, we use the components of DeBlois’ model (2001, 2003) for interpreting cognitive activities to analyze elements in the knowledge-building process. Our article ends with a comparison of the benefits of each analytical framework, which could have implications for teacher training on programming in the classroom.},

Since few problem solvers actually explore the entire search space, the paper also presents an empirical analysis of the speedup provided by abstraction when a heuristic searchisemployed. The empirical analysis shows that the benefit of abstraction is largely determined by the portion of the base-level search space explored. Thus, using breadth-first search, which searches the entire space, abstraction provides an exponential reduction in search. However, using a depth-first search, the search reduction is smaller and depends on the amount of backtracking required to solve the problem.

	abstract = {In this philosophical paper, I discuss and illustrate the necessary three ingredients that together could allow a collective phenomenon to be labelled as “emergent.” First, the phenomenon, as usual, requires a group of natural objects entering in a non-linear relationship and potentially entailing the existence of various semantic descriptions depending on the human scale of observation. Second, this phenomenon has to be observed by a mechanical observer instead of a human one, which has the natural capacity for temporal or spatial integration, or both. Finally, for this natural observer to detect and select the collective phenomenon, it needs to do so on account of the adaptive advantage this phenomenon is responsible for. The necessity for such a teleological characterization and the presence of natural selection drive us to defend, with many authors, the idea that emergent phenomena should belong only to biology. Following a brief philosophical plea, we present a simple and illustrative computer thought experiment in which a society of agents evolves a stigmergic collective behavior as an outcome of its greater adaptive value. The three ingredients are illustrated and discussed within this experimental context. Such an inclusion of the mechanical observer and the natural selection to which this phenomenon is submitted should underlie the necessary de-subjectivation that strengthens any scientific endeavor. I shall finally show why the short paths taken by ant colonies, the collective flying of birds and the maximum consumption of nutrients by a cellular metabolism are strongly emergent.},

To the extent that a skill should be a general strategy, applicable in a variety of situations, and independent of the specific knowledge of the situation, there is little evidence that problem-solving skills, as described and measured in medical education, possess these characteristics. Instead there is an accumulation of evidence that expert problem-solving in medicine is dependent on (1) a wealth of prior specific experiences which can be used in routine solution of problems by pattern recognition processes, and (2) elaborated conceptual knowledge applicable to the occasional problematic situation. The use of problem-based learning (PBL) as an educational strategy is explored. In particular, the evidence suggesting the compatibility of PBL with this theory of expertise is discussed. Finally, I review some issues in the design of PBL curricula from the perspective of the proposed model of expertise.},

Such problems can be correctly solved using either a perceptual-motor strategy (simulation of gear movements) or an abstract strategy (the parity strategy). Participants in the gesture-allowed condition were more likely to use perceptual-motor strategies than were participants in the gesture-prohibited condition. Gesture promoted use of perceptual-motor strategies both for participants who talked aloud while solving the problems (Experiment 1) and for participants who solved the problems silently (Experiment 2).

@incollection{morrison_problem_2003,
	title = {Problem {Solving}},
	abstract = {A PROBLEM ARISES when an organism has a goal (a desired state of affairs) and it is not immediately apparent how the goal can be attained. The range of problems people encounter is enormous: planning a dinner party, tracking deer, diagnosing a disease, winning a game of chess, solving mathematical equations, managing a business, or battling the latest problem with the home computer. Given this diversity, it is not surprising that every cognitive process in the human repertoire, including percep-tion, language, attention, working memory, long-term memory, categorization, judgment, and choice, plays a role in problem solving. The ability to solve problems, along with language, represents the pinnacle of human cognitive evolution. Not surprisingly, competent problem solving re-quires functioning of many brain systems. Without intact sensory systems the basic foundational informa-tion of the problem is crucially degraded. For example, a lesion to the occipital or parietal cortex could disrupt spatial perception and, hence, impair the ability to play chess. Likewise, the ability to selectively attend to various pieces of perceived sensory informa-tion is also crucial to success. Damage to the frontal and/or parietal cortex could disrupt selective attention and make it difficult to focus attention on a running deer amid a bustling landscape. The importance of selective attention extends beyond control of sensory information; problem solving may also depend on the ability to inhibit internally generated stimuli or thought processes. Extensive structured knowledge (semantic memory) is also a necessary prerequisite for expert problem solving. Damage to temporal cortex could result in the loss of access to particular categories in semantic memory necessary for solving a computer problem. Efficient storage and retrieval of event knowledge (declarative memory) is also fre-quently helpful to solve new problems. For example, it may be helpful for a doctor to recall the complaints of a previous patient in order to diagnose a new patient. Because of the complex nature of problem solving, it is difficult to isolate the precise roles of these basic processes using the methodology of cognitive neu-roscience; however, many studies have been conducted examining these processes in isolation. Our focus is on the function of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). This neural region seems to play a parti-cularly general role in problem solving and related forms of thinking and reasoning, especially those that depend on analytical intelligence (the g factor) and executive control. Based on an extensive review of the literature on the effects of frontal lesions, Stuss and Benson suggested several classes of deficits related to problem solving. Frontal damage leads to deficits in the ordering or handling of sequential behaviors; impairment in establishing, maintaining, or changing a mental ''set''; decreased ability to monitor personal behavior; dissociation of knowledge from the direc-tion of action; and various changes in normal emotional and motivational responses. Each of these classes of deficits is linked to problem solving. Planning and problem solving depend on the hierarchical organization of action and require coordination of internal goals and knowledge with the constraints of the environment. Systematic investigations of problem solving began with Gestalt psychologists such as Duncker, and the modern formulation of a general theory of problem solving is due to Newell and Simon. In their problem space formulation, problem solving has two fundamental components: forming a representation of a problem space and a search through the space. The represen-tation of a problem consists of four kinds of elements: a description of the initial state in which problem solving begins; a description of the goal state to be reached; a set of operators, or actions that can be taken, that serve to alter the current state of the problem; and path constraints that impose additional conditions on a successful path to solution. The problem space consists of the set of all states that can potentially be reached by applying the available operators. A solution is a sequence of operators that can transform the initial state into the goal state in accord with the path constraints. A problem-solving method is a procedure for finding a solution. The problem space analysis yields a mathematical result regarding the size of the search space that constrains the possible methods for solving many problems, such as the problem of winning a chess game. A typical game of chess might involve a total of 60 moves, with an average of 30 alternative legal moves available at each step along the way. The number of alternative paths is 30 60 , a number so astronomical that not even the fastest computer can play chess by exploring every possible move sequence. The exponential increase in the size of the search space with the depth of the search makes many problems impossible to solve by exhaustive search of all possible paths.},

This article proposes that creativity has three modes of existence or ways of being in the world: the Visceral (embodiments), the Ideational (mind and conceptual), and the Observational (appreciation, critical, and evaluative). We view creativity synergistically as representing both the individual creative experience and output, in conceptual and embodied ways—and also what externally shapes, enhances, and constrains creative experience. Technologies, as tools to think or create with, often mediate the operation of these three modes. We discuss each mode, instantiating it in an educational exemplar, and also engage with issues of power, discourse, and gatekeeping over what is deemed to be creative in education. Our discussion examines the rhetoric around the term, as well as issues of access to technologies that afford creativity. This tri‐modal model of creativity offers an interdisciplinary framework to complement existing models for understanding creativity.},

	abstract = {The history of aesthetics, like the histories of other sciences, may be treated in a two-fold manner: as the history of the men who created the field of study, or as the history of the questions that have been raised and resolved in the course of its pursuit. The earlier History of Aesthetics (3 volumes, 1960-68, English-language edition 1970-74) by the author of the present book was a history of men, of writers and artists who in centuries past have spoken up concerning beauty and art, form and crea tivity. The present book returns to the same subject, but treats it in a different way: as the history of aesthetic questions, concepts, theories. The matter of the two books, the previous and the present, is in part the same; but only in part: for the earlier book ended with the 17th century, while the present one brings the subject up to our own times. And from the 18th century to the 20th much happened in aesthetics; it was only in that period that aesthetics achieved recognition as a separate science, received a name of its own, and produced theories that early scholars and artists had never dreamed of.},

DURFEE, for the editors of American University Publications in Philosophy EDITORS' PREFACE While the literature on the psychology of creativity is substantial, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the subject by philos ophers in recent years. This fact is no doubt owed in 'part to the legacy of positivism, whose tenets have included a sharp distinction between what Hans Reichenbach called the context of discovery and the context of justification. Philosophy in this view must address itself to the logic of justifying hypotheses; little of philo sophical importance can be said about the more creative business of discovering them. That, positivism has held, is no more than a merely psychological question: since there is no logic of discovery or creation, there can be no philosophical reconstruction of it.},

The basic principle of distributed representations Is that the representational system of a distributed cognitive task is a set of internal and external representations, which together represent the abstract structure of the task. The basic strategy of representational analysis is to decompose the representation of a hierarchical task into its component levels so that the representational properties at each level can be independently examined. The theoretical framework and the methodology are used to analyze the hierarchical structure of the Tower of Hanoi problem. Based on this analysis, four experiments are designed to examine the representational properties of the Tower of Hanoi. Finally, the nature of external representations is discussed.},

Much research on how the adult human brain processes the social world has shown that there is a network of specific brain areas, also called the social brain, preferentially involved during social cognition. Among the specific brain areas involved in the adult social brain, functional activity in prefrontal cortex (PFC), particularly the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), is of special importance for human social cognition and behavior. However, from a developmental perspective, it has long been thought that PFC is functionally silent during infancy (first year of life), and until recently, little was known about the role of PFC in the early development of social cognition. I shall present an emerging body of recent neuroimaging studies with infants that provide evidence that mPFC exhibits functional activation much earlier than previously thought, suggesting that the mPFC is involved in social information processing from early in life. This review will highlight work examining infant mPFC function across a range of social contexts. The reviewed findings will illustrate that the human brain is fundamentally adapted to develop within a social context.},

Cognitive control involves the medial and lateral PFC but we still poorly understand how these regions guide strategy selection according to expected rewards. We addressed this issue using neuroimaging, computational modeling and model-based analyses of information flows between medial and lateral PFC. We show here that the (dorsal) medial PFC encodes and conveys to lateral PFC reward expectations driving strategy selection, while strategy selection originates in lateral PFC and propagates backward to medial PFC. This functional loop through lateral PFC enables strategy selection to further comply with learned rules encoded in lateral PFC rather than with reward expectations conveyed from medial PFC. Thus, the medial and lateral PFC are functionally coupled in cognitive control for integrating expected rewards and learned rules in strategy selection.},

	abstract = {There have been many claims by cognitive psychologists that working memory (WM) plays a role in learning during childhood, supported by studies demonstrating close links between WM skills and measures of learning and academic achievement. An important shortcoming of this approach is that it does not illuminate how and why WM is needed in the everyday classroom activities that form the basis for learning. A consistent finding from a large number of studies is a close relationship between children's performance on indicators of scholastic attainments and their WM skills. Young people with low scores on standardized assessments of reading and mathematics usually score poorly on complex memory span tasks that involve both the processing and temporary storage of verbal reading material. To illuminate the specific nature of the failed learning episodes that may be contributing to the failure of such children to make normal scholastic progress, classroom behavior of three children with poor WM abilities was observed. Four different kinds of learning failure were observed with high frequency in each of these children that could be attributed to the children failing to meet the WM demands of the activity: forgetting instructions, failing to meet combined processing and storage demands, losing track in complex tasks, and forgetting from episodic long-term memory at high rates. The chapter concludes that learning failures impair the children's chances of abstracting knowledge and skills that form the basis for functioning in the complex cognitive activities associated with the domains of literacy and mathematics.},

Yet others suggests mPFC supports memory and consolidation on time scales ranging from seconds to days. How can all these roles be reconciled? We propose that the function of the mPFC is to learn associations between context, locations, events, and corresponding adaptive responses, particularly emotional responses. Thus, the ubiquitous involvement of mPFC in both memory and decision making may be due to the fact that almost all such tasks entail the ability to recall the best action or emotional response to specific events in a particular place and time. An interaction between multiple memory systems may explain the changing importance of mPFC to different types of memories over time. In particular, mPFC likely relies on the hippocampus to support rapid learning and memory consolidation.},

	abstract = {Deep Reinforcement Learning (deep RL) has made several breakthroughs in recent years in applications ranging from complex control tasks in unmanned vehicles to game playing. Despite their success, deep RL still lacks several important capacities of human intelligence, such as transfer learning, abstraction and interpretability. Deep Symbolic Reinforcement Learning (DSRL) seeks to incorporate such capacities to deep Q-networks (DQN) by learning a relevant symbolic representation prior to using Q-learning. In this paper, we propose a novel extension of DSRL, which we call Symbolic Reinforcement Learning with Common Sense (SRL+CS), offering a better balance between generalization and specialization, inspired by principles of common sense when assigning rewards and aggregating Q-values. Experiments reported in this paper show that SRL+CS learns consistently faster than Q-learning and DSRL, achieving also a higher accuracy. In the hardest case, where agents were trained in a deterministic environment and tested in a random environment, SRL+CS achieves nearly 100\% average accuracy compared to DSRL's 70\% and DQN's 50\% accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of near perfect zero-shot transfer learning using Reinforcement Learning.},

However, a major limitation of such applications is their demand for massive amounts of training data. A critical present objective is thus to develop deep RL methods that can adapt rapidly to new tasks. In the present work we introduce a novel approach to this challenge, which we refer to as deep meta-reinforcement learning. Previous work has shown that recurrent networks can support meta-learning in a fully supervised context. We extend this approach to the RL setting. What emerges is a system that is trained using one RL algorithm, but whose recurrent dynamics implement a second, quite separate RL procedure. This second, learned RL algorithm can differ from the original one in arbitrary ways. Importantly, because it is learned, it is conﬁgured to exploit structure in the training domain. We unpack these points in a series of seven proof-of-concept experiments, each of which examines a key aspect of deep meta-RL. We consider prospects for extending and scaling up the approach, and also point out some potentially important implications for neuroscience.},

Two particlar controllers have been identiﬁed, one associated with a forward model and the prefrontal cortex and a second associated with computationally simpler, habitual, actor-critic methods and part of the striatum. We argue here for the normative appropriateness of an additional, but so far marginalized control system, associated with episodic memory, and involving the hippocampus and medial temporal cortices. We analyze in depth a class of simple environments to show that episodic control should be useful in a range of cases characterized by complexity and inferential noise, and most particularly at the very early stages of learning, long before habitization has set in. We interpret data on the transfer of control from the hippocampus to the striatum in the light of this hypothesis.},

The article surveys a vast collection of foundational methods grouped together by the commonality of their objectives, and elaborates how these methods mitigate the challenges.

	url = {https://hal.inria.fr/hal-03360307},
	abstract = {Some human cognitive tasks may involve tightly interleaved logical and numerical computations. On the one hand, ontologies allow us to describe symbolic structured knowledge and perform logical inference, providing a rather natural representation of human reasoning as modeled in cognitive psychology. On the other hand, spiking neural networks are a biologically plausible implementation of processing in brain circuits, yet they process numeric vectors rather than symbolic data. Unifying these symbolic and sub-symbolic approaches is still a wide and open question, and the Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA) based on the Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) provides a way to manipulate symbols embedded as numeric vectors that carry semantic information. In this paper, as a step towards filling the symbolic/numerical gap, we propose to map an ontology onto a SPA-based architecture with a preliminary partial implementation into spiking neural networks. More specifically, we focus on ontology standards used in the semantic web such as Resource Description Framework [Schema] (RDF[S]) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL). We provide a detailed implementation example in the case of specific RDFS entailments based on predicate chaining. To that end, we used the neural simulator Nengo with two associative memories in interaction, the first one storing assertions and the second one storing entailment rules. Reporting interesting formal results, our embedding enjoys intrinsic properties allowing semantic reasoning through distributed numerical computing. This original preliminary work thus combines symbolic and numerical approaches for cognitive modeling, which might be useful to model some complex human tasks such as ill-defined problem-solving, involving neuronal knowledge manipulation.},

As compared to synchronous and face-to-face settings, these scenarios require higher explicit coordination efforts and specific support mechanisms to reach out to inactive group members. This can be achieved by human tutors as well as through automatic interventions by the system in the organization and facilitation of group work. Our approach is based on characterizing the quality or well-functioning of collaboration using sequence alignment techniques that were originally developed in bioinformatics for the comparison of DNA sequences. Sequence alignment provides a similarity measure between pairs of action logs originating from the group work. The ensuing similarity matrix allows for clustering the working groups characterized by the similarity of their complete action logs. Notably, these clusters differ clearly in terms of quality measures related to the activity distribution and group output. This allows for determining quality indicators that can trigger feedback and adaptive scaffolding. Our data stem from inter-university online courses in which regular (weekly or bi-weekly) assignments had to be completed in small groups supported by an online forum for coordination and a separate tool for the actual collaborative writing. The basic actions are interpreted/coded as different contribution types, namely coordination, monitoring, minor/major contributions. Longer periods of inactivity are coded as another type of action (“gap”). These are the building blocks for the sequence alignment. One consequence of our analysis is a revision of the intuitive assumption that inactivity is a main indicator of inefficient group work: We found that inactivity can be compensated by early coordination to the extent that coordination is even the most important factor for successful group work. These insights are now being used to design alert mechanisms to signal inefficient group work and to generate timely interventions.},

Although some earlier examples suggest that online proctoring may reduce cheating, the potential side-effects of proctoring are largely unknown. Objectives Therefore, this study aims to identify the effects of proctoring on students' self-reported temptation to cheat and potentially undesirable side-effects, including test anxiety, perceived exam difficulty, and performance. In addition, we examine which contextual and student characteristics affect test anxiety during online exams. Methods For this, we collected four waves of survey data throughout a year of teaching during the pandemic at one faculty of a Dutch university, resulting in a total sample of 1760 students within 105 courses. Results and Conclusions Multi-level analyses showed that while proctoring had no effect on the temptation to cheat, exam difficulty or performance, students reported higher levels of test anxiety. Some learning strategies, internet literacy, access to a reliable technology and a dedicated study space as well as gender and financial stress affect their test anxiety. To conclude, the decision to use online proctoring needs to consider the undesirable side-effect on test anxiety. We discuss practical implications for university administrators, educational designers and teachers to reduce test anxiety.},

	abstract = {Background Though pedagogical artificial agents are expected to play a crucial role in the years to come, earlier studies provide inconsistent results regarding their effect on learning. This might be because their potential for exhibiting subtle nonverbal behaviours we know from human teachers has been untapped. What is more, there is little evidence of the processes underlying the effect of nonverbal behaviours of teachers (either human or artificial) on learning, so as to better guide their practical application. Objectives The aims of the current research were threefold: firstly, to examine the effect of an artificial agent's vocal expressiveness on non-verbal immediacy (teachers' ability to increase psychological closeness through nonverbal communication). Secondly, to test whether an artificial agent showing strong vocal expressiveness will enhance affective and cognitive learning (perceived and actual), as compared to an artificial agent that shows weak vocal expressiveness. Thirdly, to examine whether the underlying mechanisms of motivation and attention explain the effect of immediacy (and thereby also of vocal expressiveness) on the two learning outcomes. Methods The study used a between-participants design, with the participants being randomly assigned to one of the two experimental conditions: artificial modelling with strong expressiveness and artificial modelling with weak vocal expressiveness. Results and conclusions Results showed that an artificial agent with strong vocal expressiveness increased affective and perceived cognitive learning. Partial support was found for actual cognitive learning. What is more, our findings revealed that vocal expressiveness is related to affective and perceived cognitive learning because it promotes nonverbal immediacy. Finally, results provided evidence of motivation as a mediator of the path from immediacy to affective learning. Major takeaways The current findings verify the important role of nonverbal immediacy found in traditional educational settings. However, showing that these results also apply to artificial teachers is essential, given that the educational landscape is changing and reshaping by artificial intelligence. Thus, taking into consideration the role of vocal expressiveness in the development of artificial teachers or voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, and Google assistant, as a way to enhance immediacy and affective experience of learners is of imperative value, since they will be found more and more in our societies.},

An LMS stores all students' activities and interactions in files and databases at a very low level of granularity. Data mining (DM) techniques are applied successfully in many areas, such as business marketing, bioinformatics, and education. In particular, the area that applies DM techniques in educational settings is called educational data mining (EDM). One of the techniques used in EDM is process mining (PM). The implementation of PM activities results in models of business processes and historical information. Educational process mining (EPM) involves the analysis and discovery of processes and flows in the event logs generated by educational environments. PM is a data mining DM technique that uses event logs recorded by systems in order to discover, monitor, and improve processes in different domains.},

	abstract = {The paper presents a multi-faceted data-driven computational approach to analyse workplace-based assessment (WBA) of clinical skills in medical education. Unlike formal university-based part of the degree, the setting of WBA can be informal and only loosely regulated, as students are encouraged to take every opportunity to learn from the clinical setting. For clinical educators and placement coordinators it is vital to follow and analyse students’ engagement with WBA while on placements, in order to understand how students are participating in the assessment, and what improvements can be made. We analyse digital data capturing the students’ WBA attempts and comments on how the assessments went, using process mining and text analytics. We compare Year 1 cohorts across three years, focusing on differences between primary vs. secondary care placements. The main contribution of the work presented in this paper is the exploration of computational approaches for multi-faceted, data-driven assessment analytics for workplace learning which includes:(i) a set of features for analysing clinical skills WBA data, (ii) analysis of the temporal aspects ofthat data using process mining, and (iii) utilising text analytics to compare student reflections on WBA. We show how assessment data captured during clinical placements can provide insights about the student engagement and inform the medical education practice. Our work is inspired by Jim Greer’s vision that intelligent methods and techniques should be adopted to address key challenges faced by educational practitioners in order to foster improvement of learning and teaching. In the broader AI in Education context, the paper shows the application of AI methods to address educational challenges in a new informal learning domain - practical healthcare placements in higher education medical training.},

	abstract = {Online education is growing because of its benefits and advantages that students enjoy. Educational technologies (e.g., learning analytics, student modelling, and intelligent tutoring systems) bring great potential to online education. Many online courses, particularly in self-paced online learning (SPOL), face some inherent barriers such as learning awareness and academic intervention. These barriers can affect the academic performance of online learners. Recently, learning analytics has been shown to have great potential in removing these barriers. However, it is challenging to achieve the full potential of learning analytics with the traditional online course learning design model. Thus, focusing on SPOL, this study proposes that learning analytics should be included in the course learning design loop to ensure data collection and pedagogical connection. We propose a novel learning design-analytics model in which course learning design and learning analytics can support each other to increase learning success. Based on the proposed model, a set of online course design strategies are recommended for online educators who wish to use learning analytics to mitigate the learning barriers in SPOL. These strategies and technologies are inspired by Jim Greer’s work on student modelling. By following these recommended design strategies, a computer science course is used as an example to show our initial practices of including learning analytics in the course learning design loop. Finally, future work on how to develop and evaluate learning analytics enabled learning systems is outlined.},

Methods To validate the effectiveness of the system, we conducted a quasi-experiment with a sample of 91 caregivers of patients with suspected COVID-19 infection. Results and conclusions Results showed that the experimental group with the developed system was superior to the control group with e-pamphlet instruction in mobile devices, in terms of learning effect, perceived support, self-efficacies and reduction of anxiety during quarantine. Therefore, the mobile contextual interactive healthcare training system could be useful to improve caregivers' self-efficacies as well as their ability to care for patients in the context of COVID-19 infection prevention. Implications This is one of the few studies of the effective approach for technology-enhanced healthcare education in the COVID-19 pandemic. Some corresponding suggestions are proposed: implementing mobile contextual interactive training activities to enhance caregivers' knowledge, skills and self-efficacies; involving social interactions to relieve caregivers' anxiety; providing professional communications and support while facing difficulties in taking care of patients with suspected COVID-19 infection.},

	abstract = {It is now commonly accepted that the motor system makes use of so-called forward and inverse models in order to control the musculoskeletal system during rapid, skilled, motor behaviour. Inverse models are held to allow the system to determine the motor commands necessary to achieve a desired state, while forward models are held to allow the system to predict the expected sensory feedback of a motor command, allowing rapid error detection when actual and predicted feedback do not match. It has recently been suggested that these ideas from control theory might also be applied to the control of cognitive processes, allowing (for example) the cognitive system to anticipate processing conflict and pre-emptively minimise it by adjusting processing strategies or the allocation of processing resources.12This paper reviews theories of cognitive control that are broadly consistent with the use of complementary forward and inverse models. It is argued that there is indeed a role for such models in cognitive control – particularly in relation to a putative monitoring function – but that the models involved are likely to be somewhat impoverished.},

In this context, we note that models in philosophy are usually simple, while models in the sciences are often more complex and empirically grounded.

Based on original research and analysis of videotapes of children's play with blocks, the authors' findings suggest that such play is anything but pointless. Their conclusions fill in gaps in our current understanding of how children learn to think spatially and scientifically even while challenging portions of that understanding, including some of Piaget's thesis about the primacy of topological space in children's learning. A system of measurement developed to identify and categorize children's spontaneous behavior at play allows adults to observe patterns of behavior and record the development of process skills and cognitive abilities, enhancing our understanding of how children begin to learn about space and architectural relationships. The book also examines the educational implications of our enhanced understanding. One possible development is a new, alternative way to measure cognitive abilities and development in children based on their work with blocks.

	abstract = {Creativity does not occur in a vacuum. When we examine a creative person, creative product, or creative process, we often ignore the environmental milieu. We decontextualize creativity. The environment, however, is always present and can have a profound effect on creative expression. The environment may be involved in stimulating and supporting creativity as well as defining and evaluating it. In this vein, recent theories have acknowledged that a confluence of environment centered variables and person-centered variables (intelligence, knowledge, cognitive styles, personality, and motivation) is necessary for creativity (Amabile, 1983; Arieti, 1976; Csikszentmihalyi, 1988; Gruber, 1989; Sternberg \& Lubart, 1991, 1995). Concerning the environment, we can identify a set of interrelated contexts that influence creativity. These include the physical setting, the family, the school or workplace, the field of endeavor, and the culture. This chapter focuses on the effect of the cultural environment on creativity. Culture refers to a shared system of cognitions, behaviors, customs, values, rules, and symbols concerning the manner in which a set of people interact with their social and physical environment (Reber, 1985; Triandis, 1996). Culture is learned and socially transmitted from generation to generation. Cultural groups are often identified at the societal level, following geopolitical boundaries. Within these cultural groups there may be identifiable subcultures based on age (e.g., teen culture), socioeconomic class, religion, or other characteristics.},

We thus argue that studying goal selection is essential to advance our understanding of learning. By following existing literature in framing goal selection within a hierarchy of decision-making problems, we synthesize important findings on the principles underlying goal value attribution and exploration strategies. Ultimately, we propose that a goal-centric perspective will help develop more complete accounts of learning in both biological and artificial agents.},

It focuses on the distinction between goal-directed and habitual behaviour and how they contextualise each other. We show that habits emerge naturally (and autodidactically) from sequential policy optimisation when agents are equipped with state-action policies. In active inference, behaviour has explorative (epistemic) and exploitative (pragmatic) aspects that are sensitive to ambiguity and risk respectively, where epistemic (ambiguity-resolving) behaviour enables pragmatic (reward-seeking) behaviour and the subsequent emergence of habits. Although goal-directed and habitual policies are usually associated with model-based and model-free schemes, we find the more important distinction is between belief-free and belief-based schemes. The underlying (variational) belief updating provides a comprehensive (if metaphorical) process theory for several phenomena, including the transfer of dopamine responses, reversal learning, habit formation and devaluation. Finally, we show that active inference reduces to a classical (Bellman) scheme, in the absence of ambiguity.},

	abstract = {In human-aware planning systems, a planning agent might need to explain its plan to a human user when that plan appears to be non-feasible or sub-optimal. A popular approach, called model reconciliation, has been proposed as a way to bring the model of the human user closer to the agent’s model. To do so, the agent provides an explanation that can be used to update the model of human such that the agent’s plan is feasible or optimal to the human user. Existing approaches to solve this problem have been based on automated planning methods and have been limited to classical planning problems only.
In this paper, we approach the model reconciliation problem from a different perspective, that of knowledge representation and reasoning, and demonstrate that our approach can be applied not only to classical planning problems but also hybrid systems planning problems with durative actions and events/processes. In particular, we propose a logic-based framework for explanation generation, where given a knowledge base KBa (of an agent) and a knowledge base KBh (of a human user), each encoding their knowledge of a planning problem, and that KBa entails a query q (e.g., that a proposed plan of the agent is valid), the goal is to identify an explanation ε ⊆ KBa such that when it is used to update KBh, then the updated KBh also entails q. More specifically, we make the following contributions in this paper: (1) We formally define the notion of logic-based explanations in the context of model reconciliation problems; (2) We introduce a number of cost functions that can be used to reflect preferences between explanations; (3) We present algorithms to compute explanations for both classical planning and hybrid systems planning problems; and (4) We empirically evaluate their performance on such problems. Our empirical results demonstrate that, on classical planning problems, our approach is faster than the state of the art when the explanations are long or when the size of the knowledge base is small (e.g., the plans to be explained are short). They also demonstrate that our approach is efficient for hybrid systems planning problems.
Finally, we evaluate the real-world efficacy of explanations generated by our algorithms through a controlled human user study, where we develop a proof-of-concept visualization system and use it as a medium for explanation communication.},

Meanwhile, although deep learning has achieved significant success in many fields, the knowledge is encoded in a subsymbolic representation which is incompatible with symbolic systems such as planners. We propose Latplan, an unsupervised architecture combining deep learning and classical planning. Given only an unlabeled set of image pairs showing a subset of transitions allowed in the environment (training inputs), Latplan learns a complete propositional PDDL action model of the environment. Later, when a pair of images representing the initial and the goal states (planning inputs) is given, Latplan finds a plan to the goal state in a symbolic latent space and returns a visualized plan execution. We evaluate Latplan using image-based versions of 6 planning domains: 8-puzzle, 15-Puzzle, Blocksworld, Sokoban and Two variations of LightsOut.},

	abstract = {Associative memories have been an active area of research over the last forty years (Willshaw et al., 1969; Kohonen, 1972; Hopfield, 1982) because they form a central component of many cognitive architectures (Pollack, 1988; Anderson \& Lebiere, 1998). We focus specifically on associative memories that store associations between arbitrary pairs of neural states. When a noisy version of an input state vector is presented to the network, it must output a ”clean” version of the associated state vector. We describe a method for building large-scale networks for online learning of associations using spiking neurons, which works by exploiting the techniques of the Neural Engineering Framework (Eliasmith \& Anderson, 2003). This framework has previously been used by Stewart et al. (2011) to create memories that possess a number of desirable properties including high accuracy, a fast, feedforward recall process, and etcient scaling, requiring a number of neurons linear in the number of stored associations. These memories have played a central role in several recent neural cognitive models including Spaun, the world’s largest functional brain model (Eliasmith et al., 2012), as well as a proposal for human-scale, biologically plausible knowledge representation (Crawford et al., 2013). However, these memories are constructed using an ne optimization method that is not biologically plausible. Here we demonstrate how a similar set of connection weights can be arrived at through a biologically plausible, online learning process featuring a novel synaptic learning rule inspired in part by the well-known Oja learning rule (Oja, 1989). We present the details of our method and report the results of simulations exploring the storage capacity of these networks. We show that our technique scales up to large numbers of associations, and that recall performance degrades gracefully as the theoretical capacity is exceeded. This work has been implemented in the Nengo simulation package (http://nengo.ca), which will allow straightforward implementations of spiking neural networks on neuromorphic hardware. The result of our work is a fast, adaptive, scalable associative memory composed of spiking neurons which we expect to be a valuable addition to large systems peforming online neural computation.},

They provide a source of shared and precisely defined terms, resulting in system interoperability by knowledge sharing and reuse. Unfortunately, the variety of ways that a domain can be conceptualized results in the creation of different ontologies with contradicting or overlapping parts. For this reason ontologies need to be brought into mutual agreement (aligned). One important method for ontology alignment is the comparison of class and property names of ontologies using string-distance metrics. Today quite a lot of such metrics exist in literature. But all of them have been initially developed for different applications and fields, resulting in poor performance when applied in this new domain. In the current paper we present a new string metric for the comparison of names which performs better on the process of ontology alignment as well as to many other field matching problems.},

	abstract = {Introduction The study of human judgment under uncertainty has a history that is almost contemporaneous with that of probability theories. This is not a coincidence. From the outset, the idea of using probability to describe cognitive states or aspects of subjective judgment has provoked debate, theory construction, and empirical research. It is no exaggeration to say that probability theories have exerted a strong prescriptive influence on the study of judgment and decision making (see Gigerenzer 1994 [21] and Smithson 1989 [41] for overviews). In the modern era, proponents of the Subjective Expected Utility (SEU) framework advocated a version of Bayesianism as the benchmark for rational judgment and decision making, and this viewpoint dominated studies of human judgment and decision making during the 50's and 60's. By the late 70's and early 80's, some scholars had begun to question whether we should regard deviations from probability theories as "irrational" (cf. Cohen 198},

To achieve this goal, services must be discovered and orchestrated in a decentralized way with the minimum communication overhead whilst providing detailed information about the workflow - tasks, dependencies, location, metadata, and so on. To this end, we extended VSAs using a hierarchical vector chunking scheme that enables semantic matching at each level and provides scaling up to tens of thousands of services. We then show how VSAs can be used to encode complex workflows  by building primitives that represent sequences (pipelines) and then extend this to support full Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and apply this to five well-known Pegasus scientific workflows to demonstrate the approach},

	abstract = {Creativity is a complex process that has been studied in different fields with a high level of diversity in relation to the types of tasks, contexts, and assessment methodologies. In this study, we focus on ill-defined individual creative problem-solving (CPS) tasks with the objective of creating a computational model based on the regulatory process of CPS, inspired by the neuroscientific knowledge of the related cognitive processes, and artificial cognitive architectures. The model operationalization considers the emergent character of the path engaged by the learner when solving an ill-defined task and the geometrization of this path within a problem space describing the task. Stimulus-based and goal-directed creative behavior are then distinguished on the computational processes underlying creativity. Through a computational and neuroeducational approach, the study introduces a model of creative problem-solving tasks and provides an operational geometric definition of problem-solving tasks, emphasizing the challenges associated with ill-defined problems. We finish discussing creativity as a semantic grounding process with a focus on data representation, as well as symbolic data manipulation using inference and metric space algorithms.},

More precisely the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) allows to build a bridge between tightly interleaved numerical but also symbolic (including formal) computations. Determining how the brain can implement such processing is an important issue.
  
In the present work, following this track, we consider such an architecture with the vector symbolic architecture (VSA) formalism, and propose an implementation at a macroscopic level, instead of usual mesoscopic implementation, thus at another order of magnitude.

We also attempt to provide a better natural representation of usual human symbolic operation, considering an implementation of modal logic.

Beyond usual VSA data structures such associative memories we also introduce the notion of ``relation maps'' corresponing to relational memories, as observed in the brain.

An open-source fast implementation is provided with a benchmark and experimental observation of the method performance and limitation.},

	abstract = {Many implementations of adaptive signal processing in the nervous system are likely to require a mechanism for gain control at the single neuron level. To properly adjust the gain of an individual neuron, it may be necessary to use information carried by neurons in other parts of the system. The ability to adjust the gain of neurons in one part of the brain, using control signals arising from another, has been observed in the electrosensory system of weakly electric fish, where descending pathways to a first-order sensory nucleus have been shown to influence the gain of its output neurons. Although the neural circuitry associated with this system is well studied, the exact nature of the gain control mechanism is not fully understood. In this paper, we propose a mechanism based on the regulation of total membrane conductance via synaptic activity on descending pathways. Using a simple neural model, we show how the activity levels of paired excitatory and inhibitory control pathways can regulate the gain and baseline excitation of a target neuron.},

An optimized design for sampling, measuring volume by using the Cavalieri principle, and counting the number of neurons by using the optical disector was implemented on 50 microns-thick cresyl-violet sections. The mean total volume of the principal subdivisions of the hippocampal formation (fascia dentata, hilus, CA3-2, CA1, and subiculum) showed a negative correlation with age in normal subjects (r = -0.56, 2P {\textless} 0.05), and a 32\% mean reduction in the AD group compared with controls (P {\textless} 0.001). This finding supports the measurement of the coronal cross-sectional area and the volume of the hippocampal formation in the clinical diagnosis of AD. There was an inverse relationship between the age of normal subjects and the number of neurons in CA1 (r = -0.84, 2P {\textless} 0.0001) and subiculum (r = -0.49, 2P {\textless} 0.05) but not in other subdivisions. Pronounced AD-related reductions in neuron number were found only in the subiculum and the fascia dentata. Compared with controls, both losses represented 23\% of neurons (P {\textless} 0.05). These results 1) confirm that AD is a qualitatively different process from normal aging and 2) reveal the regional selectivity of neuron loss within the hippocampal formation in aging and AD, which may be relevant to understanding the mechanisms involved in the neuron loss associated with the two processes.},

As education becomes increasingly evidence-informed policy makers, school leaders and teachers are becoming increasingly research literate and have ready access to an ever-growing range of evidence about ‘what works’ in schools. Influential sources of evidence, such as the Education Endowment Foundation’s Teaching and Learning Toolkit, often indicate that teaching metacognition in schools can have a very positive effect on pupils’ outcomes. In this paper, we examine over 50 studies to ascertain the effect of teaching metacognition in schools on pupils’ outcomes and their wellbeing. Following our review it is clear that there is strong evidence indicating the when metacognition is effectively taught in schools then there is a very positive effect on pupil outcomes; there is less evidence about the relationship between teaching metacognition and pupil wellbeing, but the evidence which does exist is also very positive. Having identified that teaching metacognition can help improve pupil outcomes in schools, we then pose questions about the English government’s attitudes towards evidence-based practice. We ask why the government adopts some policies and strategies which have an international evidence base, while not adopting other policies or strategies which have at least an equally strong evidence base. This paper concludes by suggesting how policies and practices can be improved in schools, Initial Teacher Education establishments and at the level of national policy.},

As for its importance in the wide network of digital literacies, CT has been implemented in various educational contexts, however mostly via digital artifacts, specifically in programming-related activities. This approach does not fulfill the potential of such integration for promoting learning. In this paper, we argue that digital literacies should not be bound to the digital realm, and present a novel approach to fully integrate CT into learning and teaching by the development of CT-infused “unplugged” pedagogical tools that are fully embedded in the subject matter. We demonstrate the advantages to student learning of these tools in two case studies from K-12 mathematics education: 1) An assistive tool for function investigation in high-school calculus – in this case, we point out to how CT skills that were implemented in the tool promoted students' problem solving; 2) A teaching unit for pattern sequences in elementary school – in this case, we show how students in the CT research group outperformed students in the other groups, and how they implemented CT to solve pattern sequence problems effectively and efficiently. We highlight that besides enhancing learning, this approach can help address the important issue of equity in education, and suggest ways to promote it via dedicated professional development.},

Our goal is a better understanding of the extent to which computing and modeling with spiking neuron networks might be biologically plausible and computationally efficient. We intentionally restrict ourselves to a deterministic implementation of spiking neuron networks and we consider that the dynamics of a network is defined by a non-stochastic mapping. By staying in this rather simple framework, we are able to propose results, formula and concrete numerical values, on several topics: (i) general time constraints, (ii) links between continuous signals and spike trains, (iii) spiking neuron networks parameter adjustment. Beside an argued review of several facts and issues about neural coding by spikes, we propose new results, such as a numerical evaluation of the most critical temporal variables that schedule the progress of realistic spike trains. When implementing spiking neuron networks, for biological simulation or computational purpose, it is important to take into account the indisputable facts here unfolded. This precaution could prevent one from implementing mechanisms that would be meaningless relative to obvious time constraints, or from artificially introducing spikes when continuous calculations would be sufficient and more simple. It is also pointed out that implementing a large-scale spiking neuron network is finally a simple task.},

In this paper, based on a graph representation of \$\${\textbackslash}mathcal\{EL\}{\textbackslash}mathcal\{\}{\textasciicircum}+\$\$EL+-ontologies, we propose a new set of inference rules (called H-rules) and take advantage of them for providing a new method of computing all justifications for a given conclusion. The advantage of our setting is that most of the time, it reduces the number of inferences (generated by H-rules) required to derive a given conclusion. This accelerates the enumeration of justifications relying on these inferences. We validate our approach by running real-world ontology experiments.

This limitation of usage is mainly due to the lack of interoperability and linking of data that resides in isolated silos. Indeed, the overwhelming amount of data has worsened heterogeneity problems, as have the types of sources generating data in heterogeneous formats and different semantics. Those data related problematics are frequent in the domain of Earth Observation (EO). Earth observed data use different terminologies, which are difficult to reconcile because they reflect overlapped disciplines. These issues lead to misunderstandings and inefficient exchange and management of data in terms of access, pricing, and data rights, which can hamper environmental phenomena understanding. Virtual Knowledge Graph (VKG), allows semantic integration of existing data sources into a wide Knowledge Graph. In this work we propose a knowledge hypergraph-based approach for data integration and querying, with an application to Earth Observation data. Our proposal takes place in two phases (1) a knowledge hypergraph-based virtual data integration and (2) a hypergraph-based query processing. The first phase allows to generate a virtual knowledge hypergraph consisting of RML mappings between an ontology and the data. The second phase consists of enhancing the user's query by extracting and consolidating a global view of data from different sources based on the generated knowledge hypergraph. The proposed approach is implemented in the Onto-KIT tool (Ontology-based Knowledge hypergraph data Integration and querying Tool) and evaluated through real use case studies. The obtained results show that our proposal enhances query processing in terms of accuracy, completeness, and semantic richness of response.},

Vector symbolic architecture (VSA) started to gain attention within these methods due to the unique capabilities for representing variable-length sequences using single high-dimensional vectors. But the effect of different sequence parameters for the visual place recognition task is yet to be explored. In this work, we explore the parametrization of sequence encoding with VSA in the SeqNet variant of sequence-based visual place recognition and introduce a new hierarchical VPR method, which utilizes the proposed parametrization. We show that with our parametrization the VSA realization of sequence-based visual place recognition achieves on par results to conventional algorithms, while featuring the capability of being implemented on novel neuromorphic hardware for efficient execution.},

We not only anchor our formalization in classical learning science frameworks but we also propose to draw on neuro-cognitive models to describe the observed behaviors of learners engaged in this activity. The chosen formalism is symbolic and is aligned on upper ontologies to ensure that the vocabulary is well specified. This allows for a better communication between the summoned research fields, namely learning science, cognitive neuroscience and computational modeling. Beyond this specification purpose, we suggest performing inferences using available reasoners to better guide the analysis of the observables collected during the experiments.

These challenging learning situations can trigger self-regulated learning (SRL) skills, which students use to handle these situations. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate (a) first-year HE students’ cognitive, motivational and emotional challenges experienced in both individual and collaborative learning situations and (b) the relationship between SRL skills and experienced learning challenges. Participants included 107 first-year pre-service teachers. Data consisted of students’ self-reports via (a) open-ended answers on a challenge questionnaire and (b) Likert-scale items from MSLQ and MRS questionnaires. Based on students’ SRL profiles, differential effects on the challenging experiences were investigated. The results show that different aspects related to students’ cognition, motivation, emotions and well-being were challenging for students. Also, connections were found between students’ SRL skills and the types of experienced learning challenges. Students with high SRL reported fewer learning challenges related to motivational aspects and more challenges related to cognitive aspects than students with low SRL.

Successful individuals regulate their motivational, cognitive, and metacognitive engagement. Our hypothesis is that successful groups also share in regulating group processes. Following our earlier conceptual and empirical work on the social aspect of motivating and regulating learning ({\textless}xref{\textgreater}Hadwin \& Järvelä, 2011{\textless}/xref{\textgreater}; {\textless}xref{\textgreater}Järvenoja \& Järvelä, 2009{\textless}/xref{\textgreater}; {\textless}xref{\textgreater}Järvelä, Volet, \& Järvenoja, 2010{\textless}/xref{\textgreater}), our research questions are as follows: (a) What challenges do individuals and groups report experiencing during collaborative group work? (b) How do students collectively regulate these challenges at the time, and in future collaborations? (c) How do collaborative learning outcomes compare between groups with varying degrees of emerging shared regulation? We present an empirical study in which 18 graduate students worked in collaborative teams of 3–4 over an 8-week period. The nStudy ({\textless}xref{\textgreater}Winne, Hadwin, \& Beaudoin, 2010{\textless}/xref{\textgreater}) software was used for collaborative planning and work, as well as face-to-face and online collaboration between team members. Data included individual and collaborative statements about collaborative challenges, collaborative statements about contextual and future regulation strategies, collaborative learning performance, and log file traces of students’ contributions to collaborative chat discussions and planning activities. Findings indicated that the students expressed multiple challenges resulting in 3 kinds of regulation over time profiles: strong, progressive, and weak shared regulation. We also conclude that successful collaboration not only requires self-regulation but also allows each team member to support fellow team members to successfully regulate their learning and the team to come together to collectively regulate learning.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This article examines the role of regulatory processes in collaborative learning and how CSCL environments can be used for shared regulation of learning. First, we establish the importance of regulation processes and introduce three types of regulation contributing to successful collaboration: self-, co-, and socially shared regulation of learning. Second, we illuminate two strands of seemingly diverse research that lay an important foundation for supporting and researching regulation in CSCL contexts establishing that (a) computer-based pedagogical tools used to successfully support regulation in individual learning contexts can be leveraged for collaborative task contexts, and (b) computer-based tools for supporting collaborative knowledge construction can be leveraged for supporting regulatory processes. Finally, we draw on emerging research in our own programs of research to demonstrate how regulation can be supported and researched in CSCL environments. The article concludes by charting a course for future CSCL research focused on supporting regulated learning in collaborative task contexts.},

The “metacognitive and affective model of self-regulated learning” (the MASRL model) distinguishes two levels of functioning in SRL, namely, the Person level and the Task × Person level. At the Person level interactions between trait-like characteristics such as cognitive ability, metacognitive knowledge and skills, self-concept, perceptions of control, attitudes, emotions, and motivation in the form of expectancy-value beliefs and achievement goal orientations are hypothesized. These person characteristics guide top-down self-regulation. At the Task × Person level, that is, the level at which SRL events take place, metacognitive experiences, such as feeling of difficulty, and online affective states play a major role in task motivation and bottom-up self-regulation. Reciprocal relations between the two levels of functioning in SRL are also posited. The implications of the MASRL model for research and theory are discussed.},

In recent years, many researchers have shown an interest in developing a theory of self-regulated learning. Considerable research has been generated, but the concept is still too broadly defined and its basic foundations remain poorly understood. The purpose of this paper is to examine the theoretical underpinnings of two strongly related aspects of self-regulated learning that have, until recently, been studied in a relatively isolated fashion. The conceptual framework that is presented in this paper highlights the parallel and reciprocal relationships between components of the cognitive and motivational repertoire and centers on three levels of these repertoires: domain-specific knowledge, strategy use, and goals.},

In educational robotics, idea generation is mediated through a technological object in a process allowing us to observe the three main components of divergent thinking: fluency, flexibility, and originality. Nevertheless, divergent thinking assessment has been mainly evaluated in the last decades through semantic idea generation tasks such the Alternative Uses Test (AUT), asking participants to write different uses for familiar objects. In our study, we aimed to analyze differences in the three divergent thinking components (fluency, flexibility, and originality) through the AUT as a semantic task and through an educational robotic task that engaged the participants in building their ideas interactively. Results show that the creative components are strongly correlated within but not between the two tasks, leading us to consider the differences in the creative processes engaged when generating ideas through building with robotic objects. The role of affordances in idea generation through educational robotics is discussed as an important difference to consider in the evaluation of creativity in interactive learning environments.},

Based on this premise, the first aim of this article is to provide a theoretical integration through the development of a framework based on the principles of complex dynamic systems theory, which describes and explains children’s creativity. This model is used to explain differing views on the role of education in developing children’s creativity. Our second aim is empirical integration. On the basis of a three-dimensional taxonomy, we performed a systematic review of the recent literature (2006–2017, 184 studies) on primary school students’ creativity. Our results show that creativity is most often measured as a static, aggregated construct. In line with our theoretical model, we suggest ways that future research can elaborate on the moment-to-moment interactions that form the basis of long-term creative development, as well as on the mechanisms that connect different levels of creativity.},

	abstract = {Creativity is associated with finding novel, surprising, and useful solutions. We argue that creative cognitive processes, divergent thinking, abstraction, and improvisation are constructed on different novelty-based processes. The prefrontal cortex plays a role in creative ideation by providing a control mechanism. Moreover, thinking about novel solutions activates the distant or loosely connected neurons of a semantic network that involves the hippocampus. Novelty can also be interpreted as different combinations of earlier learned processes, such as the motor sequencing mechanism of the basal ganglia. In addition, the cerebellum is responsible for the precise control of movements, which is particularly important in improvisation. Our neurocomputational perspective is based on three creative processes centered on novelty seeking, subserved by the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, basal ganglia, and dopamine.

	abstract = {Today’s students will enter a workforce that is powerfully shaped by computing. To be successful in a changing economy, students must learn to think algorithmically and computationally, to solve problems with varying levels of abstraction. These computational thinking skills have become so integrated into social function as to represent fundamental literacies. However, computer science has not been widelytaught in K-12 schools. Efforts to create computer science standards and frameworks have yet to make their way into mandated course requirements. Despite a plethora of research on digital literacies, research on the role of computational thinking in the literature is sparse. This conceptual paper proposes a three dimensional framework for exploring the relationship between computational thinking and literacy through: 1) situating computational thinking in the literature as a literacy; 2) outlining mechanisms by which students’ existing literacy skills can be leveraged to foster computational thinking; and 3) elaborating ways in which computational thinking skills facilitate literacy development.},

	abstract = {Direct manipulation has been lauded as a good form of interface design, and some interfaces that have this property have been well received by users. In this article we seek a cognitive account of both the advantages and disadvantages of direct manipulation interfaces. We identify two underlying phenomena that give rise to the feeling of directness. One deals with the information processing distance between the user's intentions and the facilities provided by the machine. Reduction of this distance makes the interface feel direct by reducing the effort required of the user to accomplish goals. The second phenomenon concerns the relation between the input and output vocabularies of the interface language. In particular, direct manipulation requires that the system provide representations of objects that behave as if they are the objects themselves. This provides the feeling of directness of manipulation.},

It is often assumed that students master this complex cognitive skill of information problem solving all by themselves. In our point of view, however, explicit and intensive instruction is necessary. A skill decomposition is needed in order to design instruction that fosters the development of information problem solving. This research analyzes the information problem solving process of novices and experts in order to reach a detailed skill decomposition. Results reveal that experts spend more time on the main skill ‘define problem’ and more often activate their prior knowledge, elaborate on the content, and regulate their process. Furthermore, experts and novices show little differences in the way they search the Internet. These findings formed the basis for formulating instructional guidelines.},

The aim of this study is to analyze the group process dimensions in a problem-solving task with modular robotics in which creative components of fluidity, flexibility and innovation can be observed. The analysis of group process dimensions in relation to the creative components aims to understand the way group processes can support the creativity process in a problem-solving task. For this objective, 24 dyads of in-service teachers in a creative problem-solving task with modular robotics were engaged. The group process dimensions of conversation, social interaction and problem-solving was identified based on a CSCL coding schema developed for the Virtual Math Team environment. The creative components of fluidity, flexibility and innovation are operationalized based on Guilford’s Alternate Uses Test’s components. The results show the creative component of innovation is related to interactions of support within the dyad. Moreover, the participants dedicating more time to solve the task are engaged not only in more problem-solving interactions with their dyad but also in building more innovative figures, and they also make more figures together. Those results lead us to consider the importance of a positive emotional environment in the context of collaborative creation.},

We show that several studies begin to converge on a set of neural measures derived from the prefrontal cortex that can be consistently linked to processes of self-regulation. Next, we will discuss what these measures mean from a cognitive neuroscience perspective and how this knowledge could influence and/or support psychological models relevant to education.},

Here we focus on the task of storage and recall of structured knowledge in long-term memory. Specifically, we ask how recurrent neuronal networks can store and retrieve multiple knowledge structures. We model each structure as a set of binary relations between events and attributes (attributes may represent e.g., temporal order, spatial location, role in semantic structure), and map each structure to a distributed neuronal activity pattern using a vector symbolic architecture scheme.We then use associative memory plasticity rules to store the binarized patterns as fixed points in a recurrent network. By a combination of signal-to-noise analysis and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our model allows for efficient storage of these knowledge structures, such that the memorized structures as well as their individual building blocks (e.g., events and attributes) can be subsequently retrieved from partial retrieving cues. We show that long-term memory of structured knowledge relies on a new principle of computation beyond the memory basins. Finally, we show that our model can be extended to store sequences of memories as single attractors.},

	abstract = {Much research in the last two decades has demonstrated that human responses deviate from the performance deemed normative according to various models of decision making and rational judgment. This gap between the normative and the descriptive can be interpreted as indicating systematic irrationalities in human cognition. However, four alternative interpretations preserve the assumption that human behavior and cognition is largely rational. These posit that the gap is due to (1) performance errors, (2) computational limitations, (3) the wrong norm being applied by the experimenter, and (4) a different construal of the task by the subject. The authors examined the implications of individual differences in performance for each of the four explanations of the normative/descriptive gap. Performance errors are a minor factor in the gap; computational limitations underlie non-normative responding on several tasks, particularly those that involve some type of cognitive decontextualization. Unexpected patterns of covariance can suggest when the wrong norm is being applied to a task or when an alternative construal of the task should be considered appropriate.

We postulate that teaching and assessing transversal competencies could benefit from a better understanding of the learners’ behaviors in specific activities that require these competencies. To this end, computational learning sciences are an emerging field that requires the close collaboration of computational neuroscience and educational sciences to enable the assessment of learning processes. We focus on a creative problem-solving task in which the subject is engaged into building a “vehicle” by combining modular robotic cubes. As part of an exploratory research action, we propose several approaches based on symbolic to neuro-symbolic formalisms, in order to specify such a task and model the behavior and underlying cognitive processes of a subject engaged in this task. Despite being at a very preliminary stage, such a formalization seems promising to better understand complex mechanisms involved in creative problem solving at several levels: (i) the specification of the problem and the observables of interest to collect during the task; (ii) the cognitive representation of the problem space, depending on prior knowledge and affordance discovery, allowing to generate creative solution trajectories; (iii) an implementation of reasoning mechanisms within a neuronal substrate.},

We also define in this symbolic space the notion of data region (i.e., data type or concept) and the concept of projection onto such a region, so that very generic machine learning algorithms can now be applied at both the symbolic and numerical level simultaneously.
Perspectives of this alternative proposal includes human problem solving and learning issues and explicable artificial behaviors, as discussed in the conclusion.},

A fast learning strategy involves using working memory of recently rewarded objects to guide choices. A slower learning strategy uses prediction errors to gradually update value expectations to improve choices. How the fast and slow strategies work together in scenarios with real-world stimulus complexity is not well known. Here, we aim to disentangle their relative contributions in rhesus monkeys while they learned the relevance of object features at variable attentional load. We found that learning behavior across six monkeys is consistently best predicted with a model combining (i) fast working memory and (ii) slower reinforcement learning from differently weighted positive and negative prediction errors as well as (iii) selective suppression of nonchosen feature values and (iv) a meta-learning mechanism that enhances exploration rates based on a memory trace of recent
errors. The optimal model parameter settings suggest that these mechanisms cooperate differently at low and high attentional loads. Whereas working memory was essential for efficient learning at lower attentional loads, enhanced weighting of negative prediction errors and meta-learning were essential for efficient learning at higher attentional loads. Together, these findings pinpoint a canonical set of learning mechanisms and suggest how they may cooperate when subjects flexibly adjust to environments with variable real-world attentional demands.},

Actions taken by an individual in such activities are situated in time, thus allowing the creation of time sequences of observations. These observations are not purely numerical, and thus can be represented by symbolic time sequences. In particular, the formal analysis of such time sequences leads to a better understanding of the role of temporality in the adoption of CPS strategies. For this, we propose to apply clustering algorithms in order to group sequences in categories that could be associated with emergent behavioral patterns, either at the whole activity level or at the level of subsequences of actions. Clustering requires the definition of a distance between symbolic data structures representing observations, used to determine the distance (more precisely dissimilarity), and the capacity to interpret such clusters. Our ongoing research uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) as an algorithm to compute dissimilarity between sequences. This technical report addresses the issue of computing a K-means clustering algorithm and centroids with DTW for symbolic sequences, using an approximation algorithm named DTW Barycenter Averaging (DBA). It appears that DBA for symbolic sequences is not relevant as it produces non-explainable sequences for the pattern analysis, but this negative result is of interest and allows us to propose an alternative. Clustering algorithms using medoids will be preferred in future research, and we explain why in this report.},

	abstract = {Clustering is ill-defined. Unlike supervised learning where labels lead to crisp performance criteria such as accuracy and squared error, clustering quality depends on how the clusters will be used. Devising clustering criteria that capture what users need is difficult. Most clustering algorithms search for optimal clusterings based on a pre-specified clustering criterion. Our approach differs. We search for many alternate clusterings of the data, and then allow users to select the clustering(s) that best fit their needs. Meta clustering first finds a variety of clusterings and then clusters this diverse set of clusterings so that users must only examine a small number of qualitatively different clusterings. We present methods for automatically generating a diverse set of alternate clusterings, as well as methods for grouping clusterings into meta clusters. We evaluate meta clustering on four test problems and two case studies. Surprisingly, clusterings that would be of most interest to users often are not very compact clusterings.},

However, there is no "perfect" clustering approach outperforming its counterparts, and it is hard to evaluate and combine the results from different techniques, especially in a field without much prior knowledge, such as bioinformatics. This paper proposes a meta-clustering approach to extract information from results of different clustering techniques, so that a better interpretation of the data distribution can be obtained. A special distance measure is defined to represent the statistical "signal" of each cluster produced by various clustering techniques. The algorithm is applied to both artificial and real data Simulations show that the proposed approach is able to extract information efficiently and accurately from the input clustering structure.},

	abstract = {One of the fundamental human cognitive processes is problem solving. Most of the decisions we make relate to some kind of problems we try to solve no matter how trivial and critical the problem may be. The problem solving process entails performing in a new situation with information acquired and knowledge learned from past situations. As a higher level cognitive process, problem solving involves the correlation process effort to connect newly encounter problem object(s) with the object-attribute-relation (OAR) model representation of knowledge in the brain. The goal of problem solving is to search along various solution paths within the problem solver's knowledge base in the memory. When a problem object is identified, problem solving can be perceived as a search process in the memory space for finding a relationship between a set of problem-solving goals and a set of alternative paths. This paper presents a mathematical and cognitive model that describes problem solving as a cognitive process. The cognitive structures of the brain and the mechanisms of internal knowledge representation behind the cognitive process of problem solving are explained. The cognitive process is then formally and rigorously described using real-time process algebra (RTPA) base on the aforementioned models. Extended discussions are presented on applications of the cognitive process model of problem solving in software engineering and psychology.},

Although some authors claim that robotics in classrooms may be a promising new tool to address the creativity crisis in school, we often face a lack of theoretical development of the concept of creativity and the mechanisms involved. In this article, we will first provide an overview of existing research using educational robotics to foster creativity. We show that in this line of work the exact mechanisms promoted by robotics activities are rarely discussed. We use a confluence model of creativity to account for the positive effect of designing and coding robots on students' creative output. We focus on the cognitive components of the process of constructing and programming robots within the context of existing models of creative cognition. We address as well the question of the role of meta-reasoning and emergent strategies in the creative process. Then, in the second part of the article, we discuss how the notion of creativity applies to robots themselves in terms of the creative processes that can be embodied in these artificial agents. Ultimately, we argue that considering how robots and humans deal with novelty and solve open-ended tasks could help us to understand better some aspects of the essence of creativity.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The problem becomes more tractable if learning outcomes are seen as more a function of students' activities than of their fixed characteristics. The teacher's job is then to organise the teaching/learning context so that all students are more likely to use the higher order learning processes which “academic” students use spontaneously. This may be achieved when all components are aligned, so that objectives express the kinds of understanding that we want from students, the teaching context encourages students to undertake the learning activities likely to achieve those understandings, and the assessment tasks tell students what activities are required of them, and tell us how well the objectives have been met. Two examples of aligned teaching systems are described: problem-based learning and the learning portfolio.},

The basic idea is to decompose a complex task into multiple domains in space and time based on the predictability of the environmental dynamics. The system is composed of multiple modules, each of which consists of a state prediction model and a reinforcement learning controller. The “responsibility signal,” which is given by the softmax function of the prediction errors, is used to weight the outputs of multiple modules, as well as to gate the learning of the prediction models and the reinforcement learning controllers. We formulate MMRL for both discrete-time, finite-state case and continuous-time, continuous-state case. The performance of MMRL was demonstrated for discrete case in a nonstationary hunting task in a grid world and for continuous case in a nonlinear, nonstationary control task of swinging up a pendulum with variable physical parameters.},

We conducted a systematic review of empirical studies in ERIC, IEEE, Springer, and Web of Science databases. We included 91 studies for the final analysis and categorized their measures and instruments. We find a prevalence of learning assessments over engagement and usability assessments. Learning is mainly evaluated by direct measures, while indirect measures mostly assess engagement and usability. The use of indirect measures and instruments without psychometric qualities compromises the strength of the evidence for the effectiveness of game-based learning. Future studies should add direct assessments and indirect measures with psychometric qualities to assess engagement and usability. The study's limitations are discussed.},

	abstract = {Contemporary learning theories emphasize active construction of knowledge and understandings (Brown \& Campione, 1996; Bruning, Schraw, \& Ronning, 1999). Historically, models portrayed self-regulated learning (SRL) as an individual, cognitive-constructive activity (e.g., Winne, 1997; Zimmerman, 1989b) focusing on individual differences associated with SRL including self-efficacy, metacognition, goal setting, and achievement. Social context was viewed as a component in the triadic process of self-regulation (e.g., Schunk \& Zimmerman, 1997). New perspectives of learning emphasize shared knowledge construction. Consequently, a range of models of regulated learning have emerged moving along a continuum from individual constructivist perspectives to social constructionist perspectives of learning (Meyer \& Turner, 2002). This chapter synthesizes the current state of research about social aspects in the regulation of learning, contrasting self-regulation, co-regulation, and socially shared regulation of learning. This chapter includes four main sections: (1) the role of social in the regulation of learning; (2) contrasting self-regulated learning, co-regulated learning, and socially shared regulation; (3) research about self-regulated learning, co-regulated learning, and socially shared regulation; and (4) challenges for theory and research about the regulation of learning.

In the present review, we examine the empirical evidence to support such a phenomenon. A total of 17 articles addressing SSRL were identified, 13 of which presented empirical evidence. Through a narrative review it could be concluded that there is enough data to maintain the existence of SSRL in comparison to other social regulation (e.g., co-regulation). It was found that most of the SSRL research has focused on characterizing phenomena through the use of mixed methods through qualitative data, mostly video-recorded observation data. Also, SSRL seems to contribute to students’ performance. Finally, the article discusses the need for the field to move forward, exploring the best conditions to promote SSRL, clarifying whether SSRL is always the optimal form of collaboration, and identifying more aspects of groups’ characteristics.},

	abstract = {Self-regulated learning (SRL) includes the cognitive, metacognitive, behavioral, motivational, and emotional/affective aspects of learning. It is, therefore, an extraordinary umbrella under which a considerable number of variables that influence learning (e.g., self-efficacy, volition, cognitive strategies) are studied within a comprehensive and holistic approach. For that reason, SRL has become one of the most important areas of research within educational psychology. In this paper, six models of SRL are analyzed and compared; that is, Zimmerman; Boekaerts; Winne and Hadwin; Pintrich; Efklides; and Hadwin, Järvelä and Miller. First, each model is explored in detail in the following aspects: (a) history and development, (b) description of the model (including the model figures), (c) empirical support, and (d) instruments constructed based on the model. Then, the models are compared in a number of aspects: (a) citations, (b) phases and subprocesses, (c) how they conceptualize (meta)cognition, motivation and emotion, (d) top–down/bottom–up, (e) automaticity, and (f) context. In the discussion, the empirical evidence from the existing SRL meta-analyses is examined and implications for education are extracted. Further, four future lines of research are proposed. The review reaches two main conclusions. First, the SRL models form an integrative and coherent framework from which to conduct research and on which students can be taught to be more strategic and successful. Second, based on the available meta-analytic evidence, there are differential effects of SRL models in light of differences in students’ developmental stages or educational levels. Thus, scholars and teachers need to start applying these differential effects of the SRL models and theories to enhance students’ learning and SRL skills.},

	abstract = {Students’ regulation has been conceptualized as an important impetus for effective and efficient collaborative learning. However, little empirical evidence has been reported about language learners’ regulatory behaviors in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL). The purpose of this study is to investigate the occurrence of self and social aspects of regulation during wiki-supported collaborative reading activities in the context of learning English as a foreign language (EFL). Sixty Chinese college students organized in twelve groups participated in this study over a sixteen-week semester. Using an integrated method of content analysis and sequential analysis, students’ chat logs were coded and analyzed to explore the characteristics of students’ self and social regulatory behaviors in terms of regulation type, regulation process, and regulation focus. Results indicate that all groups demonstrated active social regulation in the collaborative activities. Compared with low-performing groups, high-performing groups displayed distinctively different patterns of regulatory behaviors in “social regulation,” “evaluating,” “content monitoring,” and “social emotional regulation.” Moreover, the analysis further reveals a more continuous and smooth regulation in the high-performing groups, while low-performing groups tended to be lost in a single repeated regulatory behavior pattern such as “self-regulation” or “organizing”. This study not only fills a gap in the current collaborative English learning literature, but also contributes to our knowledge of social regulation in CSCL. Pedagogical implications and future research are also addressed.},

These neuronal assemblies are proposed to be involved in the processing of memory traces during sleep. However, despite this rapidly growing body of experimental data, evidence for the influence of sleep discharge patterns on memory traces remains fragmentary. The underlying role of sleep in learning and memory has yet to be precisely characterized.},

One type of task investigated was immediate free recall, assumed to reflect the holding capacity of the working memory. The other type of task investigated was represented by syntactical reasoning and problem-solving tasks, assumed to reflect the processing (the mental transformation of input) and monitoring capacity of the working memory. Two experiments with a repeated-measures design were performed. Experiment 1 showed a significant decline in performance as a function of sleep loss on Raven's progressive matrices, a problem-solving task. No other main effect of sleep loss was found. Experiment 2 had a different order between tasks than Experiment 1 and the time without sleep was increased. A number-series induction task was also used in Experiment 2. A significant, negative effect of sleep loss in performance on Raven's progressive matrices was found in Experiment 2. The effects of sleep loss on the other tasks were nonsignificant. It is suggested that Raven's progressive-matrices task reflects the ability to monitor encoding operations (selective attention) and to monitor mental “computations”.},

Then, after a 12-h period involving sleep or wake, they attempted target problems structurally related to the source problems but with different surface features. Experiment 2 controlled for time of day effects by testing participants either in the morning or the evening.

We first review and analyse the psychological and neuroscientific literature on the mechanisms and processes organisms use to deal with these challenges. We then analyse existing computational models thereof. Finally we present the design of a computational framework that integrates the reviewed knowledge. The framework can be used both as a theoretical guidance to interpret empirical data and design new experiments, and to design computational models addressing specific problems debated in the literature.},

The author suggests that natural vision depends on the eyes in the head on a body supported by the ground, the brain being only the central organ of a complete visual system.

More recently, Goodale and Milner redefined the two visual systems with a focus on the different ways in which visual information is transformed for different goals. They relabeled the dorsal stream as a “how” system for transforming visual information using an egocentric frame of reference in preparation for direct action. This paper reviews recent research from psychophysics, neurophysiology, neuropsychology and neuroimaging to define the roles of the ventral and dorsal visual processing streams.

This book clarifies the role ontologies play in knowledge representation; it discusses the distinctions with their use in philosophy, gives insight in the features, rationale and limitations of the OWL 2 web ontology language, and provides a critical review of methodologies and design principles advocated to improve the quality of ontologies. It covers both theory and practice of knowledge acquisition, representation and ontologies; it emphasises human understanding as knowledge structuring principle, and demonstrates this approach in the development of a core ontology of basic legal concepts (LKIF Core) and in the exploration of expressive ontology design patterns for the representation of social reality, change and causation, actions and transactions. In doing so it contributes to a better understanding of the representation of ontologies; or rather, what it means to do ontology representation.},

	abstract = {Problem-solving methods for knowledge-based systems establish the behavior of such systems by defining the roles in which domain knowledge is used and the ordering of inferences. Developers can compose problem-solving methods that accomplish complex application tasks from primitive, reusable methods. The key steps in this development approach are task analysis, method selection (from a library), and method configuration. Protégé-ii is a knowledge-engineering environment that allows developers to select and configure problem-solving methods. In addition, Protégé-ii generates domain-specific knowledge-acquisition tools that domain specialists can use to create knowledge bases on which the methods may operate. The board-game method is a problem-solving method that defines control knowledge for a class of tasks that developers can model in a highly specific way. The method adopts a conceptual model of problem solving in which the solution space is construed as a “game board” on which the problem solver moves “playing pieces” according to prespecified rules. This familiar conceptual model simplifies the developer's cognitive demands when configuring the board-game method to support new application tasks. We compare configuration of the board-game method to that of a chronological-backtracking problem-solving method for the same application tasks (for example, towers of Hanoi and the Sisyphus room-assignment problem). We also examine how method designers can specialize problem-solving methods by making ontological commitments to certain classes of tasks. We exemplify this technique by specializing the chronological-backtracking method to the board-game method.},

Data were collected over 3 waves from 8th and 9th graders (N = 150) in their math classrooms using both self-report questionnaires and actual math grades. There was a general decline in adaptive outcomes over time, but these trends were moderated by the different patterns of multiple goals. In line with normative goal theory, mastery goals were adaptive; but also in line with the revised goal theory perspective, approach performance goals, when coupled with mastery goals, were just as adaptive.

The goal of this paper is to present the field of ontologies and give an overview of recent research in the field, in the context of education. As this paper presents a literature review, papers from the last five years were collected from the IEEE Xplore database, analysed and categorized based on the use of ontologies for: curriculum modelling and management, describing learning domains, learning data, and e-learning services. From the collected papers, a slightly growing trend in the contribution of ontologies to educational systems can be observed. Most studies used ontologies for describing learning domains, and some of the 95 collected papers could not fit in just one category because a system used more than one ontology. Throughout the work, the following contributions have been made: the term ontology was defined, the most common types of ontologies and commonly used methodologies for building ontologies were identified, and an overview of existing systems that use ontologies in the domain of education was given.},

Ontology is a way to model learners and learning resources, among others, which helps to retrieve details. This, in turn, generates more relevant materials to learners. Ontologies have benefits of reusability, reasoning ability, and supports inference mechanisms, which helps to provide enhanced recommendations.

	abstract = {Our memories are remarkably dynamic and allow us to reinterpret the past once new information comes to light. Gaining novel insights can lead to mental reorganization of previously unrelated events, thus linking them into narratives. The hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) support integration of partially overlapping events, but the neural mechanisms underlying the reorganization of memories for the formation of coherent narratives remain elusive. Here, we combine fMRI with The Sims 3 videos of life-like animated events, which could either be integrated into narratives or not. We show that insight triggers the emergence of de novo mnemonic representations of the narratives and is associated with increased neural similarity between linked event representations in the posterior hippocampus, mPFC, and autobiographical-memory network. Simultaneously, events irrelevant to the newly established memory of the narrative were pruned out. This process was accompanied by increased neural dissimilarity between non-linked event representations in the posterior hippocampus and mPFC and was additionally signaled by a mismatch response in the anterior hippocampus. Our results demonstrate that insight leads to neural reconﬁguration of representational networks within a memory space and have implications for knowledge acquisition in educational settings.},

We also predicted that self-reported epistemic beliefs (i. e. assumptions about the nature and acquisition of knowledge) would be related to ill-defined, but not well-defined, solutions. Results confirmed these predictions. We concluded that well-defined and ill-defined problems require separate cognitive processes and that epistemic beliefs play an important role in ill-defined problem solving.

The analysis and design of such games require integrating game design activities with educational design concepts (such as learning objectives, assessment methods, and educational content design). In addition, the integration of these domains require interdisciplinary team. As a result, a clear, concise communication between team members is a difficult goal to achieve and ambiguity could arise. An ontology, as a domain modeling tool, could be used as a meta-model to guide a SEG design and the development team, in addition to bridging the communication gap between the game design and pedagogic domains. There is little proof that a comprehensive web-enabled SEGs’ ontology, which is characterized by completion, consistency, and reusability, exists. This paper presents our attempt to build a comprehensive web enabled SEGs ontology that could be exploited in the era of the semantic web to be shared and reused by the SEGs’ development community.

Each VCPO has its own set of attributes, they note, leading to different purposes, functions, aesthetic outcomes, and narratives. They argue that one key to understanding the impact of these toys is to determine, based on the diversity of their attributes, each VCPO's level of affordance. The authors suggest that the specific qualities of some play materials may help establish the scientific, mathematical, and technological foundations required in such professional disciplines as architecture and engineering. In contrast, they argue that the use of VCPOs hobbled by formulaic, scripted play properties may have the opposite effect, that the use of products manufactured with specialized, commercialized themes runs the risk of impeding self-regulation and even creative ideation. They hope their findings serve as a starting point for future studies that examine the benefits and shortcomings of specific play objects on cognitive development and creativity.},

To this end, we analyzed neuroimaging from N=200 participants across seven tasks that cover the broad range of cognitive domains. The CMC framework was translated into a model of neural connectivity between brain regions homologous to CMC components. After the model was implemented and fitted using Dynamic Causal Modeling, its performance was compared against four alternative large-scale brain architectures that had been previously proposed in the field of neuroscience. The results show that the CMC outperforms the other four architectures within and across all domains. These findings suggest that a common, functional computational blueprint for human-like intelligence also captures the neural architecture that underpins human cognition.},

	abstract = {Analyzing learning traces is presently highly required in e-learning environment. Several communities have been developed to address this need, such as those of Learning Analytics and Educational Data Mining. The main step of performing a learning analytics process is the educational data collection. Actually, learning environments such as Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) generate a big amount of educational data. They can be divided into assessment data, collaboration data, communication data, and so on. When we focus on assessment, we can launch a new source of data that can be analyzed and hence contribute to the improvement of learning analytics field. In this paper, we explore, investigate and compare the set of learning analytics models in the literature. Then, we study them from assessment point of view. The only current learning analytics model which can support tracking and modeling assessment data is the xAPI data model. For this reason, we study and investigate the xAPI specification from assessment point of view. Based on identified weaknesses of xAPI specification, we propose an enhancement of its data model. This is to support the assessment analytics effectively. We present an ontological model for assessment analytics inspired from the xAPI specification. To validate our approach, we focus on massive learning traces extracted from a real MOOC. Thus, we define and execute the set of proposed steps of preprocessing stage that extracts assessment data from whole learning data. Furthermore, we develop a java semantic web application to convert assessment data extracted to OWL file according to our proposed ontological model for assessment analytics.},

	abstract = {In recent years two main technologies for knowledge sharing and reuse have emerged: ontologies and problem solving methods (PSMs). Ontologies specify reusable conceptualizations which can be shared by multiple reasoning components communicating during a problem solving process. PSMs describe in a domain-independent way the generic reasoning steps and knowledge types needed to perform a task. Typically PSMs are specified in a task-specific fashion, using modelling frameworks which describe their control and inference structures as well as their knowledge requirements and competence. In this paper we discuss a novel approach to PSM specification, which is based on the use of formal ontologies. In particular our specifications abstract from control, data flow and other dynamic aspects of PSMs to focus on the logical theory associated with a PSM (method ontology). This approach concentrates on the competence and knowledge requirements of a PSM, rather than internal control details, thus enabling black-box-style reuse. In the paper we also look at the nature of PSM specifications and we show that these can be characterised in a task-independent style as generic search strategies. The resulting 'modelling gap' between methodindependent task specifications and task-independent method ontologies can be bridged by constructing the relevant adapter ontology, which reformulates the method ontology in task-specific terms. An important aspect of the ontologycentred approach described here is that, in contrast with other characterisations of task-independent PSMs, it does away with the simple, binary distinction between weak and strong methods. We argue that any method can be defined in either taskindependent or task-dependent style and therefore such distinction is of limited utility in PSM reuse. The differences between PSMs which affect reuse concern the ontological commitments which they make with respect to domain knowledge and goal specifications.},

	abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the success of deep neural networks in many research areas. The fundamental idea behind the design of most neural networks is to learn similarity patterns from data for prediction and inference, which lacks the ability of cognitive reasoning. However, the concrete ability of reasoning is critical to many theoretical and practical problems. On the other hand, traditional symbolic reasoning methods do well in making logical inference, but they are mostly hard rule-based reasoning, which limits their generalization ability to different tasks since difference tasks may require different rules. Both reasoning and generalization ability are important for prediction tasks such as recommender systems, where reasoning provides strong connection between user history and target items for accurate prediction, and generalization helps the model to draw a robust user portrait over noisy inputs. In this paper, we propose Logic-Integrated Neural Network (LINN) to integrate the power of deep learning and logic reasoning. LINN is a dynamic neural architecture that builds the computational graph according to input logical expressions. It learns basic logical operations such as AND, OR, NOT as neural modules, and conducts propositional logical reasoning through the network for inference. Experiments on theoretical task show that LINN achieves significant performance on solving logical equations and variables. Furthermore, we test our approach on the practical task of recommendation by formulating the task into a logical inference problem. Experiments show that LINN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation models in Top-K recommendation, which verifies the potential of LINN in practice.},

	abstract = {The underconfidence-with-practice (UWP) effect is a common finding in calibration studies concerned with judgments of learning (JOLs) elicited on a percentage scale. The UWP pattern is present when, in a procedure consisting of multiple study–test cycles, the mean scale JOLs underestimate the mean recall performance on Cycle 2 and beyond. Although this pattern is present both for items recalled and unrecalled on the preceding cycle, to date research has concentrated mostly on the sources of UWP for the latter type of items. In the present study, we aimed to bridge this gap. In three experiments, we examined calibration on the third of three cycles. The results of Experiment 1 demonstrated the typical pattern of higher recall and scale JOLs for previously recalled items than for unrecalled ones. More importantly, they also revealed that even though the UWP effect was found for items previously recalled both once and twice, its magnitude was greater for the former class of items. Experiments 2 and 3, which employed a binary betting task and a binary 0 \%/100 \% JOL task, respectively, demonstrated that people can accurately predict future recall for previously recalled items with binary decisions. In both experiments, the UWP effect was absent for both items recalled once and twice. We suggest that the sensitivity of scale JOLs, but not binary judgments, to the number of previous recall successes strengthens the claim of Hanczakowski, Zawadzka, Pasek, and Higham (Journal of Memory and Language 69:429–444, 2013) that scale JOLs reflect confidence in, rather than the subjective probability of, future recall.},

	abstract = {Current theoretical and computational models of dopamine-based reinforcement learning are largely rooted in the classical behaviorist tradition, and envision the organism as a purely reactive recipient of rewards and punishments, with resulting behavior that essentially reflects the sum of this reinforcement history. This framework is missing some fundamental features of the affective nervous system, most importantly, the central role of goals in driving and organizing behavior in a teleological manner. Even when goal-directed behaviors are considered in current frameworks, they are typically conceived of as arising in reaction to the environment, rather than being in place from the start. We hypothesize that goal-driven cognition is primary, and organized into two discrete phases: goal selection and goal engaged, which each have a substantially different effective value function. This dichotomy can potentially explain a wide range of phenomena, playing a central role in many clinical disorders, such as depression, OCD, ADHD, and PTSD, and providing a sensible account of the detailed biology and function of the dopamine system and larger limbic system, including critical ventral and medial prefrontal cortex. Computationally, reasoning backward from active goals to action selection is more tractable than projecting alternative action choices forward to compute possible outcomes. An explicit computational model of these brain areas and their function in this goal-driven framework is described, as are numerous testable predictions from this framework.},

It’s focused, mainly, on the SM cognitive diagnosis process, and we present a method providing a rich diagnosis about the student’s knowledge state – especially, about the state of learning objectives reached or not.

	abstract = {The field of adaptive e-learning is continuously developing. More research is being conducted in this area as adaptive e-learning aims to provide learners with adaptive learning paths and content, according to their individual characteristics and needs, which makes e-learning more efficient and effective. The learner model, which is a representation of different learner’s characteristics, plays a key role in this adaptation. This paper presents a systematic literature review about learner modelling during the last 5 years, describing the different modelled characteristics and the adopted modelling techniques and modeling types: automatic modeling and collaborative modeling. 107 publications were selected and analyzed, and six categories of the modelled characteristics were identified. This literature review contributes to the identification of the learners’ individual traits and presents the most used modelling techniques for each of them. It also identifies the latest research trends of Learner Modeling and generates future research directions in this field.},

The review highlights the shared definition of achievement goal orientations and identity formation styles as mental frames that guide interpretation of situations, define standards for action, and direct coping with challenges. Despite differences in unit-of-analysis and general focus, both perspectives emphasize the qualitative differences between mental frames that are oriented towards self-development and those that are oriented towards self-worth validation and enhancement. Also, recent theorizing in both perspectives highlights the role of contexts and situations in adolescents’ adoption of certain achievement goal orientations and identity formation styles. The article concludes with research questions concerning the potential reciprocal relations between adolescents’ academic achievement goal orientations and identity formation styles.},

	abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) brings the power of deep neural networks to bear on the generic task of trial-and-error learning, and its effectiveness has been convincingly demonstrated on tasks such as Atari video games and the game of Go. However, contemporary DRL systems inherit a number of shortcomings from the current generation of deep learning techniques. For example, they require very large datasets to work effectively, entailing that they are slow to learn even when such datasets are available. Moreover, they lack the ability to reason on an abstract level, which makes it difficult to implement high-level cognitive functions such as transfer learning, analogical reasoning, and hypothesis-based reasoning. Finally, their operation is largely opaque to humans, rendering them unsuitable for domains in which verifiability is important. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning architecture comprising a neural back end and a symbolic front end with the potential to overcome each of these shortcomings. As proof-of-concept, we present a preliminary implementation of the architecture and apply it to several variants of a simple video game. We show that the resulting system -- though just a prototype -- learns effectively, and, by acquiring a set of symbolic rules that are easily comprehensible to humans, dramatically outperforms a conventional, fully neural DRL system on a stochastic variant of the game.},

However, the neural computations that are explained by RL algorithms fall short of explaining many sophisticated aspects of human learning and decision making, including the generalization of behavior to novel contexts, one-shot learning, and the synthesis of task information in complex environments. Instead, these aspects of behavior are assumed to be supported by the brain’s executive functions (EF). We review recent findings that highlight the importance of EF in instrumental learning. Specifically, we advance the theory that EF sets the stage for canonical RL computations in the brain, providing inputs that broaden their flexibility and applicability.

According to a stimulus-driven explanation, goal-incompatible stimuli that are easy/difficult to control lead to the tendency to fight/flee. According to a goal-directed explanation, on the other hand, the tendency to fight/flee occurs when the expected utility of fighting/fleeing is the highest. Participants did a computer task in which they were confronted with goal-incompatible stimuli that were (a) easy to control and fighting had the highest expected utility, (b) easy to control and fleeing had the highest expected utility, and (c) difficult to control and fleeing and fighting had zero expected utility. After participants were trained to use one hand to fight and another hand to flee, they either had to choose a response or merely observe the stimuli. During the observation trials, single-pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) was applied to the primary motor cortex 450 ms post-stimulus onset and motorevoked potentials (MEPs) were measured from the hand muscles. Results showed that participants chose to fight/flee when the expected utility of fighting/fleeing was the highest, and that they responded late when the expected utility of both responses was low. They also showed larger MEPs for the right/left hand when the expected utility of fighting/fleeing was the highest. This result can be interpreted as support for the goal-directed account, but only if it is assumed that we were unable to override the presumed natural mapping between hand (right/left) and response (fight/flight).},

A key challenge for provably safe deep RL is that repeatedly verifying neural networks within a learning loop is computationally infeasible. We address this challenge using two policy classes: a general, neurosymbolic class with approximate gradients and a more restricted class of symbolic policies that allows efficient verification. Our learning algorithm is a mirror descent over policies: in each iteration, it safely lifts a symbolic policy into the neurosymbolic space, performs safe gradient updates to the resulting policy, and projects the updated policy into the safe symbolic subset, all without requiring explicit verification of neural networks. Our empirical results show that Revel enforces safe exploration in many scenarios in which Constrained Policy Optimization does not, and that it can discover policies that outperform those learned through prior approaches to verified exploration.},

	abstract = {Executive function (EF) accounts have now been offered for several disorders with childhood onset (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism, early-treated phenylketonuria), and EF has been linked to the development of numerous abilities (e.g., attention, rule use, theory of mind). However, efforts to explain behavior in terms of EF have been hampered by an inadequate characterization of EF itself. What is the function that is accomplished by EF? The present analysis attempts to ground the construct of EF in an account of problem solving and thereby to integrate temporally and functionally distinct aspects of EF within a coherent framework. According to this problem-solving framework, EF is a macroconstruct that spans 4 phases of problem solving (representation, planning, execution, and evaluation). When analyzed into subfunctions, macroconstructs such as EF permit the integration of findings from disparate content domains, which are often studied in isolation from the broader context of reasoning and action. A review of the literature on the early development of EF reveals converging evidence for domain-general changes in all aspects of EF.},

First, novelty detection can be grounded in the sensorimotor experience and allow higher order appraisal. Second, cognitive processes, such as those involved in self-assessment, influence emotional states by eliciting affects like boredom and frustration. Third, emotional processes such as those triggered by self-assessment influence attentional processes. Last, close emotion-cognition interactions implement an efficient feedback loop for the purpose of top-down behavior regulation. The latter is what we call ‘Emotional Metacontrol’. We introduce a model based on artificial neural networks. This architecture is used to control a robotic system in a visual search task. The emotional metacontrol intervenes to bias the robot visual attention during active object recognition. Through a behavioral and statistical analysis, we show that this mechanism increases the robot performance and fosters the exploratory behavior to avoid deadlocks.},

	abstract = {Cette thèse propose de construire un cadre de travail de modélisation systémique, pour aider à la compréhension de l'organisation des systèmes associant le cortex préfrontal (PFC) et les ganglions de la base (BG) et de leurs interactions fonctionnelles dans les processus de prise de décision et de comportement dirigé par les buts chez les humains. Un environnement de jeu vidéo, Minecraft, est utilisé pour concevoir des expériences. Elles visent à tester le jeu vidéo dans un environnement qui pourrait être plus complexe et réaliste, si besoin. Ce cadre, avec l'expérimentation virtuelle, forme une architecture en boucle fermée pour l'étude de comportements animaux de haut niveau. Le cadre des systèmes neuronaux de ce travail repose sur la dynamique des réseaux entre des sous-systèmes du PFC et des BG. Le PFC joue un rôle crucial dans les fonctions exécutives comme la planification, l'attention, le comportement dirigé par les buts, etc. Les BG sont un groupe de noyaux sous-corticaux qui ont fait l'objet d'études approfondies dans le domaine du contrôle moteur et de la sélection de l'action. Différentes régions dans le PFC et les structures au sein des BG sont organisées anatomiquement, en boucles parallèles et séparées (chacune d'entre elles étant appelée une boucle CBG). Ces boucles peuvent être, à un niveau abstrait, divisées en 3 types : les boucles limbiques, les boucles associatives et les boucles sensorimotrices. Tout d'abord, un cadre global avec ces boucles parallèles a été mis en oeuvre. L'accent est mis sur les boucles limbiques. Les boucles associatives et sensori-motrices sont modélisées de manière algorithmique, à l'aide de la plate-forme d'expérimentation pour le contrôle moteur. Pour ce qui concerne les boucles limbiques, le cortex orbitofrontal (OFC) représente une boucle pour estimer les préférences et la boucle du cortex cingulaire antérieur (ACC) représente les besoins internes. Le substrat correspondant de ces boucles dans les BG est le striatum ventral (VS), beaucoup étudié pour son rôle dans le codage des valeurs. Des scénarios simples sont conçus dans l'environnement virtuel en utilisant l'agent, certains objets et des récompenses appétitives dans l'environnement. Les boucles limbiques ont été implémentées selon des modèles existants de prise de décision dans les BG. Ainsi, le cadre théorique et la plateforme expérimentale servent de banc d'essai pour ces modèles spécifiques qui doivent s'adapter dans une perspective plus large. Ensuite, nous utilisons ce cadre pour étudier de plus près le rôle de l’OFC dans la prise de décision guidée par la valeur et le comportement dirigé par les buts. Dans le cadre de cette thèse, des observations importantes sur le rôle de l’OFC dans le comportement ont été intégrées en consolidant de nombreuses données expérimentales. [...]},

In Neural Engineering, Chris Eliasmith and Charles Anderson provide a synthesis of the disparate approaches current in computational neuroscience, incorporating ideas from neural coding, neural computation, physiology, communications theory, control theory, dynamics, and probability theory. This synthesis, they argue, enables novel theoretical and practical insights into the functioning of neural systems. Such insights are pertinent to experimental and computational neuroscientists and to engineers, physicists, and computer scientists interested in how their quantitative tools relate to the brain.The authors present three principles of neural engineering based on the representation of signals by neural ensembles, transformations of these representations through neuronal coupling weights, and the integration of control theory and neural dynamics. Through detailed examples and in-depth discussion, they make the case that these guiding principles constitute a useful theory for generating large-scale models of neurobiological function. A software package written in MatLab for use with their methodology, as well as examples, course notes, exercises, documentation, and other material, are available on the Web.},

Modality-specific ‘embodied’ mechanisms anchored in sensorimotor systems appear to be relevant, as are ‘disembodied’ mechanisms in multimodal areas. In this paper, four semantic mechanisms are proposed and spelt out at the level of neuronal circuits: referential semantics, which establishes links between symbols and the objects and actions they are used to speak about; combinatorial semantics, which enables the learning of symbolic meaning from context; emotional-affective semantics, which establishes links between signs and internal states of the body; and abstraction mechanisms for generalizing over a range of instances of semantic meaning. Referential, combinatorial, emotional-affective, and abstract semantics are complementary mechanisms, each necessary for processing meaning in mind and brain.},

	abstract = {One goal of researchers in neuroscience, psychology, and artificial intelligence is to build theoretical models that are able to explain the flexibility and adaptiveness of biological systems. How to build a brain provides a detailed guided exploration of a new cognitive architecture that takes biological detail seriously, while addressing cognitive phenomena. The Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA) introduced in this book provides a set of tools for constructing a wide range of biologically constrained perceptual, cognitive, and motor models. Examples of such models are provided, and they are shown to explain a wide range of data including single cell recordings, neural population activity, reaction times, error rates, choice behavior, and fMRI signals. Each of these models introduces a major feature of biological cognition addressed in the book, including semantics, syntax, control, learning, and memory. These models are not introduced as independent considerations of brain function, but instead integrated to give rise to what is currently the world's largest functional brain model. The last half of this book compares the Semantic Pointer Architecture with the current state-of-the-art, addressing issues of theory construction in the behavioral sciences, semantic compositionality, and scalability, among other considerations. The book concludes with a discussion of conceptual challenges raised by this architecture, and identifies several outstanding challenges for this, and other, cognitive architectures. Along the way, the book considers neural coding, concept representation, neural dynamics, working memory, neuroanatomy, reinforcement learning, and spike-timing dependent plasticity. The book includes 8 detailed, hands-on tutorials exploiting the free Nengo neural simulation environment, providing practical experience with the concepts and models presented throughout.},

However, the literature is actually not explicit about how these terms can be deﬁned; whether they are distinct; and whether they refer to overt manifestations, learning processes, or learning outcomes. Thus, a framework is provided here that offers a way to differentiate active, constructive, and interactive in terms of observable overt activities and underlying learning processes. The framework generates a testable hypothesis for learning: that interactive activities are most likely to be better than constructive activities, which in turn might be better than active activities, which are better than being passive. Studies from the literature are cited to provide evidence in support of this hypothesis. Moreover, postulating underlying learning processes allows us to interpret evidence in the literature more accurately. Specifying distinct overt activities for active, constructive, and interactive also offers suggestions for how learning activities can be coded and how each kind of activity might be elicited.},

We first introduce the revolutionary roots of the theory in the works of Marx and Vygotsky, and the evolution of the unit of analysis through different generations of activity theory. We then discuss the foundational role of historicity and dialectics in activity theory. We identify two central epistemological-methodological principles that guide activity-theoretical studies, namely the principle of double stimulation and the principle of ascending from the abstract to the concrete. These principles lead us to emphasize formative interventions as a powerful way to conduct societally impactful activity-theoretical research. We conclude by pointing out some major challenges facing activity theory in the 21st century.

Особое внимание уделяется работе так называемой Хельсинской школы теории деятельности. В первой части статьи мы описываем революционные идеи, лежащие в основе теории и уходящие корнями в работы Маркса и Выготского, а также рассматриваем, как менялись представления о единице анализа на разных этапах становления теории деятельности. Затем мы переходим к обсуждению основополагающей роли историчности и диалектичности в развитии теории деятельности, описываем два ключевых методологических и эпистемологических принципа деятельностных исследований — принцип двойной стимуляции и принцип восхождения от общего к частному. Опора на эти принципы дает нам возможность утверждать, что формирующие интервенции — мощный инструмент в реализации социально значимых, эффективных деятельностных исследований. В заключительной части статьи мы рассматриваем основные вызовы, с которыми придется столкнуться теории деятельности в XXI веке.},

	abstract = {Vygotsky refers to a waiting experiment and uses it as an example to conceptualize double stimulation as human beings' ability to willfully transform conflictual circumstances with the help of auxiliary means. This experiment can be considered a key to a Vygotskian view on this topic, which can significantly contribute to today's discussions of ways to support transformative agency. In this article we provide an overview of a waiting experiment, recently conducted with the specific aim of testing a Vygotskian model of the emergence of volitional action. While confirming this model, the findings suggest two extensions to it. One extension is the inclusion of participants' life activity. The second extension, closely related to the first one, points at fluid and iterative movements that may occur between and within the phases of the model, due to the interference of life activity and conformity to the experimental setup.},

The creative use of digital technologies to solve problems is also related to computational thinking as a set of cognitive and metacognitive strategies in which the learner is engaged in an active design and creation process and mobilized computational concepts and methods. At different educational levels, computational thinking can be developed and assessed through solving ill-defined problems. This paper introduces computational thinking in the context of Higher Education creative programming activities. In this study, we engage undergraduate students in a creative programming activity using Scratch. Then, we analyze the computational thinking scores of an automatic analysis tool and the human assessment of the creative programming projects. Results suggested the need for a human assessment of creative programming while pointing the limits of an automated analytical tool, which does not reflect the creative diversity of the Scratch projects and overrates algorithmic complexity.},

	abstract = {Computational thinking (CT) is a key 21st-century skill. This paper contributes to CT research by investigating CT predictors among upper secondary students in a longitudinal and natural classroom setting. The hypothesized predictors are grouped into three areas: student characteristics, home environment, and learning opportunities. CT is measured with the Computational Thinking Test (CTt), an established performance test. N = 202 high-school students, at three time points over one school year, act as the sample and latent growth curve modeling as the analysis method. CT self-concept, followed by reasoning skills and gender, show the strongest association with the level of CT. Computer literacy, followed by duration of computer use and formal learning opportunities during the school year, have the strongest association with CT growth. Variables from all three areas seem to be important for predicting either CT level or growth. An explained variance of 70.4\% for CT level and 61.2\% for CT growth might indicate a good trade-off between the comprehensiveness and parsimony of the conceptual framework. The findings contribute to a better understanding of CT as a construct and have implications for CT instruction, e.g., the role of computer science and motivation in CT learning.},

	abstract = {Introduction of scientific and cultural aspects of Computer Science (CS) (called "Computational Thinking" - CT) in K-12 education is fundamental. We focus on three crucial areas. 1. Historical, philosophical, and pedagogical aspects. What are the big ideas of CS we must teach? What are the historical and pedagogical contexts in which CT emerged, and why are relevant? What is the relationship between learning theories (e.g., constructivism) and teaching approaches (e.g., plugged and unplugged)? 2. Cognitive aspects. What is the sentiment of generalist teachers not trained to teach CS? What misconceptions do they hold about concepts like CT and "coding"? 3. Affective and motivational aspects. What is the impact of personal beliefs about intelligence (mindset) and about CS ability? What the role of teaching approaches? This research has been conducted both through historical and philosophical argumentation, and through quantitative and qualitative studies (both on nationwide samples and small significant ones), in particular through the lens of (often exaggerated) claims about transfer from CS to other skills. Four important claims are substantiated. 1. CS should be introduced in K-12 as a tool to understand and act in our digital world, and to use the power of computation for meaningful learning. CT is the conceptual sediment of that learning. We designed a curriculum proposal in this direction. 2. The expressions CT (useful to distantiate from digital literacy) and "coding" can cause misconceptions among teachers, who focus mainly on transfer to general thinking skills. Both disciplinary and pedagogical teacher training is hence needed. 3. Some plugged and unplugged teaching tools have intrinsic constructivist characteristics that can facilitate CS learning, as shown with proposed activities. 4. Growth mindset is not automatically fostered by CS, while not studying CS can foster fixed beliefs. Growth mindset can be fostered by creative computing, leveraging on its constructivist aspects.},

It examines some complications in allocating resources between the two, particularly those introduced by the distribution of costs and benefits across time and space, and the effects of ecological interaction. Two general situations involving the development and use of knowledge in organizations are modeled. The first is the case of mutual learning between members of an organization and an organizational code. The second is the case of learning and competitive advantage in competition for primacy. The paper develops an argument that adaptive processes, by refining exploitation more rapidly than exploration, are likely to become effective in the short run but self-destructive in the long run. The possibility that certain common organizational practices ameliorate that tendency is assessed.},

This process takes a noisy approximation of a state and recovers the original information. As a particular example, we consider the cleanup required for the use of Vector Symbolic Architectures, which provide a method for manipulating symbols using a ﬁxed-length vector representation. To recognize the result of these manipulations, a mechanism for cleaning up the resulting noisy representation is needed, as this noise increases with the number of symbols being combined. While these symbolic manipulations have previously been modelled with biologically plausible neurons, this paper presents the ﬁrst spiking neuron model of the cleanup process. We demonstrate that it approaches ideal performance and that the neural requirements scale linearly with the number of distinct symbols in the system. While this result is relevant for any biological model requiring cleanup, it is crucial for VSAs, as it completes the set of mechanisms needed to provide a full neural implementation of symbolic reasoning.},

It proposes that both learning and action planning involve processes minimizing prediction errors encoded by dopaminergic neurons. In this framework, dopaminergic neurons projecting to different parts of the striatum encode errors in predictions made by the corresponding systems within the basal ganglia. The dopaminergic neurons encode differences between rewards and expectations in the goal-directed system, and differences between the chosen and habitual actions in the habit system. These prediction errors trigger learning about rewards and habit formation, respectively. Additionally, dopaminergic neurons in the goal-directed system play a key role in action planning: They compute the difference between a desired reward and the reward expected from the current motor plan, and they facilitate action planning until this difference diminishes. Presented models account for dopaminergic responses during movements, effects of dopamine depletion on behaviour, and make several experimental predictions.},

	abstract = {Decision-making is usually accompanied by metacognition, through which a decision maker monitors uncertainty regarding a decision and may then consequently revise the decision. These metacognitive processes can occur prior to or in the absence of feedback. However, the neural mechanisms of metacognition remain controversial. One theory proposes an independent neural system for metacognition in the prefrontal cortex (PFC); the other, that metacognitive processes coincide and overlap with the systems used for the decision-making process per se. In this study, we devised a novel “decision–redecision” paradigm to investigate the neural metacognitive processes involved in redecision as compared to the initial decision-making process. The participants underwent a perceptual decision-making task and a rule-based decision-making task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We found that the anterior PFC, including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and lateral frontopolar cortex (lFPC), were more extensively activated after the initial decision. The dACC activity in redecision positively scaled with decision uncertainty and correlated with individual metacognitive uncertainty monitoring abilities—commonly occurring in both tasks—indicating that the dACC was specifically involved in decision uncertainty monitoring. In contrast, the lFPC activity seen in redecision processing was scaled with decision uncertainty reduction and correlated with individual accuracy changes—positively in the rule-based decision-making task and negatively in the perceptual decision-making task. Our results show that the lFPC was specifically involved in metacognitive control of decision adjustment and was subject to different control demands of the tasks. Therefore, our findings support that a separate neural system in the PFC is essentially involved in metacognition and further, that functions of the PFC in metacognition are dissociable.},

	abstract = {Along evolution, increasingly complex cognitive functions have been attributed to an increasingly complex brain architecture. Nevertheless, the brain remains anchored on an organization dedicated to survival. We believe that keeping this principle in mind is an excellent way to better decipher cerebral mechanisms and corresponding cognitive functions. Accordingly, we describe here the main characteristics and constraints of an intelligent agent learning to survive in an intelligent environment, in terms of information ﬂows and learning principles. On this basis, we propose a framework of description for the architecture of the brain of mammals, organized around four fundamental questions to be answered. These questions deﬁne the identity of the goal (what ?) and the motivation to choose it (why ?), its location (where ?) and the way to get it (how ?). Then we explain how the main requirements of respondent and operant conditioning can be addressed within this architecture and how it is also compatible with the elaboration of more complex cognitive mechanisms. This can be seen as the validation of this framework to explore how cognitive functions might emerge from cerebral circuits and how they have been made more complex along evolution. It also proposes a systemic view of the brain, useful to develop the cognitive architecture of an intelligent agent exploring autonomously its environment and to propose to machine learning innovative algorithms.},

	abstract = {Recent computational theories of decision making in humans and animals have portrayed 2 systems locked in a battle for control of behavior. One system—variously termed model-free or habitual—favors actions that have previously led to reward, whereas a second— called the model-based or goal-directed system—favors actions that causally lead to reward according to the agent’s internal model of the environment. Some evidence suggests that control can be shifted between these systems using neural or behavioral manipulations, but other evidence suggests that the systems are more intertwined than a competitive account would imply. In 4 behavioral experiments, using a retrospective revaluation design and a cognitive load manipulation, we show that human decisions are more consistent with a cooperative architecture in which the model-free system controls behavior, whereas the model-based system trains the model-free system by replaying and simulating experience.},

Techniques based on temporal differences, however, suffer from a serious drawback: as stochastic adaptive algorithms, they may need extensive exploration of the state-action space before convergence is achieved. Although the basic methods are now reasonably well understood, it is precisely the structural simplicity of the reinforcement learning principle – learning through experimentation – that causes these excessive demands on the learning agent. Additionally, one must consider that the agent is very rarely a tabula rasa: some rough knowledge about characteristics of the surrounding environment is often available. In this paper, I present methods for embedding a priori knowledge in a reinforcement learning technique in such a way that both the mathematical structure of the basic learning algorithm and the capacity to generalise experience across the state-action space are kept. Extensive experimental results show that the resulting variants may lead to good performance, provided a sensible balance between risky use of prior imprecise knowledge and cautious use of learning experience is adopted.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks have proved very successful on archetypal tasks for which large training sets are available, but when the training data are scarce, their performance suffers from overfitting. Many existing methods of reducing overfitting are data-independent, and their efficacy is often limited when the training set is very small. Data-dependent regularizations are mostly motivated by the observation that data of interest lie close to a manifold, which is typically hard to parametrize explicitly and often requires human input of tangent vectors. These methods typically only focus on the geometry of the input data, and do not necessarily encourage the networks to produce geometrically meaningful features. To resolve this, we propose a new framework, the Low-Dimensional-Manifold-regularized neural Network (LDMNet), which incorporates a feature regularization method that focuses on the geometry of both the input data and the output features. In LDMNet, we regularize the network by encouraging the combination of the input data and the output features to sample a collection of low dimensional manifolds, which are searched efficiently without explicit parametrization. To achieve this, we directly use the manifold dimension as a regularization term in a variational functional. The resulting Euler-Lagrange equation is a Laplace-Beltrami equation over a point cloud, which is solved by the point integral method without increasing the computational complexity. We demonstrate two benefits of LDMNet in the experiments. First, we show that LDMNet significantly outperforms widely-used network regularizers such as weight decay and DropOut. Second, we show that LDMNet can be designed to extract common features of an object imaged via different modalities, which proves to be very useful in real-world applications such as cross-spectral face recognition.},

Hypervectors provide powerful and noise-robust representations and VSAs are associated with promising theoretical properties for approaching high-level cognitive tasks. However, a major drawback of VSAs is the lack of opportunities to learn them from training data. Their power is merely an effect of good (and elaborate) design rather than learning. We exploit highlevel knowledge about the structure of reactive robot problems to learn a VSA based on training data. We demonstrate preliminary results on a simple navigation task. Given a successful demonstration of a navigation run by pairs of sensor input and actuator output, the system learns a single hypervector that encodes this reactive behaviour. When executing (and combining) such VSA-based behaviours, the advantages of hypervectors (i.e. the representational power and robustness to noise) are preserved. Moreover, a particular beauty of this approach is that it can learn encodings for behaviours that have exactly the same form (a hypervector) no matter how complex the sensor input or the behaviours are.},

Furthermore, VTB influences the vector length less, which also benefits a neural implementation. Consequently, we argue that VTB is an improvement over HRRs for neurally implemented VSAs.},

	abstract = {Recent applications of autonomous agents and robots, such as self-driving cars, scenario-based trainers, exploration robots, and service robots have brought attention to crucial trust-related challenges associated with the current generation of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. AI systems based on the connectionist deep learning neural network approach lack capabilities of explaining their decisions and actions to others, despite their great successes. Without symbolic interpretation capabilities, they are black boxes, which renders their decisions or actions opaque, making it difficult to trust them in safety-critical applications. The recent stance on the explainability of AI systems has witnessed several approaches on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI); however, most of the studies have focused on data-driven XAI systems applied in computational sciences. Studies addressing the increasingly pervasive goal-driven agents and robots are still missing. This paper reviews approaches on explainable goal-driven intelligent agents and robots, focusing on techniques for explaining and communicating agents perceptual functions (example, senses, and vision) and cognitive reasoning (example, beliefs, desires, intention, plans, and goals) with humans in the loop. The review highlights key strategies that emphasize transparency, understandability, and continual learning for explainability. Finally, the paper presents requirements for explainability and suggests a roadmap for the possible realization of effective goal-driven explainable agents and robots.},

	abstract = {Building large-scale brain models is one method used by theoretical neuroscientists to understand the way the human brain functions. Researchers typically use either a bottom-up approach, which focuses on the detailed modelling of various biological properties of the brain and places less importance on reproducing functional behaviour, or a top-down approach, which generally aim to reproduce the behaviour observed in real cognitive agents, but typically sacrifices adherence to constraints imposed by the neuro-biology. The focus of this thesis is Spaun, a large-scale brain model constructed using a combination of the bottom-up and top-down approaches to brain modelling. Spaun is currently the world’s largest functional brain model, capable of performing eight distinct cognitive tasks ranging from digit recognition to inductive reasoning. The thesis is organized to discuss three aspects of the Spaun model. First, it describes the original Spaun model, and explores how a top-down approach, known as the Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA), has been combined with a bottom-up approach, known as the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF), to integrate six existing cognitive models into a unified cognitive model that is Spaun. Next, the thesis identifies some of the concerns with the original Spaun model, and show the modifications made to the network to remedy these issues. It also characterizes how the Spaun model was re-organized and re-implemented (to include the aforementioned modifications) as the Spaun 2.0 model. As part of the discussion of the Spaun 2.0 model, task performance results are presented that compare the original Spaun model and the re-implemented Spaun 2.0 model, demonstrating that the modifications to the Spaun 2.0 model have improved its accuracy on the working memory task, and the two induction tasks. Finally, three extensions to Spaun 2.0 are presented. These extensions take advantage of the re-organized Spaun model, giving Spaun 2.0 new capabilities – a motor system capable of adapting to unknown force fields applied to its arm; a visual system capable of processing 256×256 full-colour images; and the ability to follow general instructions. The Spaun model and architecture presented in this thesis demonstrate that by using the SPA and the NEF, it is not only possible to construct functional large-scale brain models, but to do so in a manner that supports complex extensions to the model. The final Spaun 2.0 model consists of approximately 6.6 million neurons, can perform 12 cognitive tasks, and has been demonstrated to reproduce behavioural and neurological data observed in natural cognitive agents.},

	url = {https://uwspace.uwaterloo.ca/handle/10012/13498},
	abstract = {I present the context-unified encoding (CUE) model, a large-scale spiking neural network model of human memory. 
It combines and integrates activity-based short-term memory with weight-based long-term memory. 
The implementation with spiking neurons ensures biological plausibility and allows for predictions on the neural level. 
At the same time, the model produces behavioural outputs that have been matched to human data from serial and free recall experiments. 
In particular, well-known results such as primacy, recency, transposition error gradients, and forward recall bias have been reproduced with good quantitative matches. 
Additionally, the model accounts for the effects of the acetylcholine antagonist scopolamine, and the Hebb repetition effect. 
 
The CUE model combines and extends the ordinal serial encoding (OSE) model, a spiking neuron model of short-term memory, and the temporal context model (TCM), a mathematical model of free recall. 
To the former, a neural mechanism for tracking the list position is added. 
The latter is converted into a spiking neural network under considerations of the main features and simplification of equations where appropriate. 
Previous models of the recall process in the TCM are replaced by a new independent accumulator recall process that is more suited to the integration into a large-scale network. 
To implement the modification of the required association matrices, a novel learning rule, the association matrix learning rule (AML), is derived that allows for one-shot learning without catastrophic forgetting. 
Its biological plausibility is discussed and it is shown that it accounts for changes in neural firing observed in human recordings from an association learning experiment. 
Furthermore, I discuss a recent proposal of an optimal fuzzy temporal memory as replacement for the TCM context signal and show it to be likely to require more neurons than there are in the human brain. 
 
To construct the CUE model, I have used the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) and Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA). 
This thesis makes novel contributions to both. 
I propose to distribute NEF intercepts according to the distribution of cosine similarities of random uniformly distributed unit vectors. 
This leads to a uniform distribution of active neurons and reduces the error introduced by spiking noise considerably in high-dimensional neuronal representations. 
It improves the asymptotic scaling of the noise error with dimensions d from O(d) to O(d{\textasciicircum}(3/4))\$. 
These results are applied to achieve improved Semantic Pointer representations in neural networks are on par with or better than previous methods of optimizing neural representations for the Semantic Pointer Architecture. 
Furthermore, the vector-derived transformation binding (VTB) is investigated as an alternative to circular convolution in the SPA, with promising results.},

	abstract = {The successor representation (SR) is a candidate principle for generalization in reinforcement learning, computational accounts of memory, and the structure of neural representations in the hippocampus. Given a sequence of states, the SR learns a predictive representation for every given state that encodes how often, on average, each upcoming state is expected to be visited, even if it is multiple steps ahead. A discount or scale parameter determines how many steps into the future SR’s generalizations reach, enabling rapid value computation, subgoal discovery, and ﬂexible decision-making in large trees. However, SR with a single scale could discard information for predicting both the sequential order of and the distance between states, which are common problems in navigation for animals and artiﬁcial agents. Here we propose a solution: an ensemble of SRs with multiple scales. We show that the derivative of multi-scale SR can reconstruct both the sequence of expected future states and estimate distance to goal. This derivative can be computed linearly: we show that a multi-scale SR ensemble is the Laplace transform of future states, and the inverse of this Laplace transform is a biologically plausible linear estimation of the derivative. Multi-scale SR and its derivative could lead to a common principle for how the medial temporal lobe supports both map-based and vector-based navigation.},

Given such a formal description, either tractability or intractability of the problem is established, by proving that the problem either enjoys a polynomial time algorithm or is NP-hard. However, this problem description is in fact an abstraction of the actual problem of being in A and desiring to go to B: it focuses on the relevant aspects of the problem (e.g., distances between landmarks and crossings) and leaves out a lot of irrelevant details.},

The Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) proposes one such theory, but has not yet gathered signiﬁcant empirical support, partly due to the technical challenge of building and simulating large-scale models with the NEF. Nengo is a software tool that can be used to build and simulate large-scale models based on the NEF; currently, it is the primary resource for both teaching how the NEF is used, and for doing research that generates speciﬁc NEF models to explain experimental data. Nengo 1.4, which was implemented in Java, was used to create Spaun, the world’s largest functional brain model (Eliasmith et al., 2012). Simulating Spaun highlighted limitations in Nengo 1.4’s ability to support model construction with simple syntax, to simulate large models quickly, and to collect large amounts of data for subsequent analysis. This paper describes Nengo 2.0, which is implemented in Python and overcomes these limitations. It uses simple and extendable syntax, simulates a benchmark model on the scale of Spaun 50 times faster than Nengo 1.4, and has a ﬂexible mechanism for collecting simulation results.},

	abstract = {Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs) combine a high-dimensional vector space with a set of carefully designed operators in order to perform symbolic computations with large numerical vectors. Major goals are the exploitation of their representational power and ability to deal with fuzziness and ambiguity. Over the past years, VSAs have been applied to a broad range of tasks and several VSA implementations have been proposed. The available implementations differ in the underlying vector space (e.g., binary vectors or complex-valued vectors) and the particular implementations of the required VSA operators – with important ramiﬁcations for the properties of these architectures. For example, not every VSA is equally well suited to address each task, including complete incompatibility. This paper provides an overview of eleven available VSA implementations and discusses their commonalities and differences in the underlying vector space, bundling, and binding/unbinding operations. We create a taxonomy of available binding/unbinding operations and show an important ramiﬁcation for non self-inverse binding operations using an example from analogical reasoning. A main contribution is the experimental comparison of the available implementations in order to evaluate (1) the capacity of bundles, (2) the approximation quality of non-exact unbinding operations, (3) the inﬂuence of combining binding and bundling operations on the query answering performance, and (4) the performance on two example applications: visual place recognition and language recognition. An overall good performance is shown by the Holographic Reduced Representations VSA in the frequency domain (FHRR). However, its non-self-inverse binding mechanism can negatively inﬂuence its applicability, e.g. to analogical reasoning. Self-inverting VSAs like MAP or BSC are better suited for such applications. We expect this systematization and comparison to be relevant for development and evaluation of new VSAs, but most importantly, to support the selection of an appropriate VSA for a particular task. The implementations are available in form of a MATLAB toolbox to simplify testing different VSAs for new applications.},

	abstract = {We present a novel method for constructing neurally implemented spatial representations that we show to be useful for building models of spatial cognition. This method represents continuous (i.e., real-valued) spaces using neurons, and identiﬁes a set of operations for manipulating these representations. Speciﬁcally, we use “fractional binding” to construct “spatial semantic pointers” (SSPs) that we use to generate and manipulate representations of spatial maps encoding the positions of objects. We show how these representations can be transformed to answer queries about the location and identities of objects, move the relative or global position of items, and answer queries about regions of space, among other things. We demonstrate that the neural implementation in spiking networks of SSPs have similar accuracy and capacity as the mathematical ideal.},

	abstract = {Spatial Semantic Pointers (SSPs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for representing and transforming continuous space, with numerous applications to cognitive modelling and deep learning. Fundamental to SSPs is the notion of "similarity" between vectors representing different points in \$n\$-dimensional space -- typically the dot product or cosine similarity between vectors with rotated unit-length complex coefficients in the Fourier domain. The similarity measure has previously been conjectured to be a Gaussian function of Euclidean distance. Contrary to this conjecture, we derive a simple trigonometric formula relating spatial displacement to similarity, and prove that, in the case where the Fourier coefficients are uniform i.i.d., the expected similarity is a product of normalized sinc functions: \${\textbackslash}prod\_\{k=1\}{\textasciicircum}\{n\} {\textbackslash}operatorname\{sinc\} {\textbackslash}left( a\_k {\textbackslash}right)\$, where \${\textbackslash}mathbf\{a\} {\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}n\$ is the spatial displacement between the two \$n\$-dimensional points. This establishes a direct link between space and the similarity of SSPs, which in turn helps bolster a useful mathematical framework for architecting neural networks that manipulate spatial structures.},

	abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the cutting edge model for supervised machine learning in computer vision. In recent years CNNs have outperformed traditional approaches in many computer vision tasks such as object detection, image classification and face recognition. CNNs are vulnerable to overfitting, and a lot of research focuses on finding regularization methods to overcome it. One approach is designing task specific models based on prior knowledge. Several works have shown that properties of natural images can be easily captured using complex numbers. Motivated by these works, we present a variation of the CNN model with complex valued input and weights. We construct the complex model as a generalization of the real model. Lack of order over the complex field raises several difficulties both in the definition and in the training of the network. We address these issues and suggest possible solutions. The resulting model is shown to be a restricted form of a real valued CNN with twice the parameters. It is sensitive to phase structure, and we suggest it serves as a regularized model for problems where such structure is important. This suggestion is verified empirically by comparing the performance of a complex and a real network in the problem of cell detection. The two networks achieve comparable results, and although the complex model is hard to train, it is significantly less vulnerable to overfitting. We also demonstrate that the complex network detects meaningful phase structure in the data.},

	abstract = {Human behavior modeling is a key component in application domains such as healthcare and social behavior research. In addition to accurate prediction, having the capacity to understand the roles of human behavior determinants and to provide explanations for the predicted behaviors is also important. Having this capacity increases trust in the systems and the likelihood that the systems actually will be adopted, thus driving engagement and loyalty. However, most prediction models do not provide explanations for the behaviors they predict. In this paper, we study the research problem, human behavior prediction with explanations, for healthcare intervention systems in health social networks. We propose an ontology-based deep learning model (ORBM+) for human behavior prediction over undirected and nodes-attributed graphs. We first propose a bottom-up algorithm to learn the user representation from health ontologies. Then the user representation is utilized to incorporate self-motivation, social influences, and environmental events together in a human behavior prediction model, which extends a well-known deep learning method, the Restricted Boltzmann Machine. ORBM+ not only predicts human behaviors accurately, but also, it generates explanations for each predicted behavior. Experiments conducted on both real and synthetic health social networks have shown the tremendous effectiveness of our approach compared with conventional methods.},

To do so, we define a new intermediate knowledge representation (KR) contained within this intersection: Description Logic Programs (DLP), and the closely related Description Horn Logic (DHL) which is an expressive fragment of first-order logic (FOL). DLP provides a significant degree of expressiveness, substantially greater than the RDF-Schema fragment of Description Logic. We show how to perform DLP-fusion: the bidirectional translation of premises and inferences (including typical kinds of queries) from the DLP fragment of DL to LP, and vice versa from the DLP fragment of LP to DL. In particular, this translation enables one to "build rules on top of ontologies": it enables the rule KR to have access to DL ontological definitions for vocabulary primitives (e.g., predicates and individual constants) used by the rules. Conversely, the DLP-fusion technique likewise enables one to "build ontologies on top of rules": it enables ontological definitions to be supplemented by rules, or imported into DL from rules. It also enables available efficient LP inferencing algorithms/implementations to be exploited for reasoning over large-scale DL ontologies.},

It is within this context that we already developed the Biomolecular Network Ontology especially for the semantic understanding of the behaviour of complex biomolecular networks and their transittability. However, the challenge now is how to automatically populate it from a variety of biological documents. To this end, the target of this paper is to propose a new approach to automatically populate the Biomolecular Network Ontology and take advantage of the vast amount of biological knowledge expressed in heterogeneous unstructured data about complex biomolecular networks. Indeed, we have recently observed the emergence of deep learning techniques that provide significant and rapid progress in several domains, particularly in the process of deriving high-quality information from text. Despite its significant progress in recent years, deep learning is still not commonly used to populate ontologies. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based NLP ontology population system to populate the Biomolecular Network Ontology. Its originality is to jointly exploit deep learning and natural language processing techniques to identify, extract and classify new instances referring to the BNO ontology’s concepts from textual data. The preliminary results highlight the efficiency of our proposal for ontology population.},

The aim of this chapter is to provide an introductive survey that lays bare specific features of two basic frameworks for representing uncertainty: probability theory and possibility theory, while highlighting the main issues that the task of representing uncertainty is faced with. This purpose also provides the opportunity to position related topics, such as rough sets and fuzzy sets, respectively motivated by the need to account for the granularity of representations as induced by the choice of a language, and the gradual nature of natural language predicates. Moreover, this overview includes concise presentations of yet other theoretical representation frameworks such as formal concept analysis, conditional events and ranking functions, and also possibilistic logic, in connection with the uncertainty frameworks addressed here. The next chapter in this volume is devoted to more complex frameworks: belief functions and imprecise probabilities.},

Realism is not only related to visual appearance but also to the interactions and situations in the game. This issue is particularly crucial in edutainment applications where realism impacts the learning aspect of the game experience. Introducing semantics in virtual worlds helps deﬁne intelligent objects and interactions which would turn into a more realistic game. In this work, we propose to decouple the semantic deﬁnition of the game world from its actual implementation in a general-purpose game engine. A semantic layer has been developed to bridge the semantics formalized by ontologies with its realization in the engine. Thanks to this software library, semantics can be speciﬁed in a separate formal module and reused in different projects. The proposed approach has been tested to design a serious game concept set in the marine environment.},

The project arose from the observation that current hybrid systems are generally small-scale experimental systems which couple one symbolic and one connectionist model, often in an ad hoc fashion. Hence the objective of building a versatile testbed for the design, prototyping and assessment of a variety of hybrid models or architectures, in particular those which combine diverse neural network models with rule/model-based, cased-based, and fuzzy reasoning. A multiagent approach has been chosen to facilitate modular implementation of these hybrid models, which will be tested in the context of real-world applications in the steel and automobile industries. 1.

For this reason, previous research has tended to interpret deep learning techniques as data-driven methods, while few advances have been made from knowledge-driven perspectives. We propose to design a semantic rich deep learning model from a knowledge driven perspective, by introducing formal semantics into deep learning process. We propose ontology-based deep restricted Boltzmann machine (OB-DRBM), in which we use ontology to guide architecture design of deep restricted Boltzmann machines (DRBM), as well as to assist in their training and validation processes. Our model learns a set of related semantic-rich data representations from both formal semantics and data distribution. Representations in this set correspond to concepts at various semantic levels in a domain ontology. We show that our model leads to an improved performance, when compared with conventional deep learning models in classiﬁcation tasks.},

	abstract = {Complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) are a powerful modeling tool for domains where data can be naturally interpreted in terms of complex numbers. However, several analytical properties of the complex domain (e.g., holomorphicity) make the design of CVNNs a more challenging task than their real counterpart. In this paper, we consider the problem of flexible activation functions (AFs) in the complex domain, i.e., AFs endowed with sufficient degrees of freedom to adapt their shape given the training data. While this problem has received considerable attention in the real case, a very limited literature exists for CVNNs, where most activation functions are generally developed in a split fashion (i.e., by considering the real and imaginary parts of the activation separately) or with simple phase-amplitude techniques. Leveraging over the recently proposed kernel activation functions (KAFs), and related advances in the design of complex-valued kernels, we propose the first fully complex, non-parametric activation function for CVNNs, which is based on a kernel expansion with a fixed dictionary that can be implemented efficiently on vectorized hardware. Several experiments on common use cases, including prediction and channel equalization, validate our proposal when compared to real-valued neural networks and CVNNs with fixed activation functions.},

	abstract = {We review the psychology and neuroscience of reinforcement learning (RL), which has experienced signiﬁcant progress in the past two decades, enabled by the comprehensive experimental study of simple learning and decisionmaking tasks. However, one challenge in the study of RL is computational: The simplicity of these tasks ignores important aspects of reinforcement learning in the real world: (a) State spaces are high-dimensional, continuous, and partially observable; this implies that (b) data are relatively sparse and, indeed, precisely the same situation may never be encountered twice; furthermore, (c) rewards depend on the long-term consequences of actions in ways that violate the classical assumptions that make RL tractable. A seemingly distinct challenge is that, cognitively, theories of RL have largely involved procedural and semantic memory, the way in which knowledge about action values or world models extracted gradually from many experiences can drive choice. This focus on semantic memory leaves out many aspects of memory, such as episodic memory, related to the traces of individual events. We suggest that these two challenges are related. The computational challenge can be dealt with, in part, by endowing RL systems with episodic memory, allowing them to (a) efﬁciently approximate value functions over complex state spaces, (b) learn with very little data, and (c) bridge long-term dependencies between actions and rewards. We review the computational theory underlying this proposal and the empirical evidence to support it. Our proposal suggests that the ubiquitous and diverse roles of memory in RL may function as part of an integrated learning system.},

They benefit from the main characteristics of games, such as engagement and immersiveness to achieve pedagogic objectives. In spite of the promising results of SEGs reported in the literature, their analysis and design still require complex tasks that incorporate game design activities within an educational context. Ontologies that include concepts, relations, and governing rules for both games and education domains could offer an approach to solve such problem. An ontology, as a domain modeling tool, could be used as a meta-model to guide a SEG designer, in addition to bridging the communication gap between the game design and pedagogic domains. This paper presents a survey of available ontologies for SEGs in the literature, in addition to comparing them. We managed to find only two SEGs’ ontologies and a meta-model in the literature, and hence presented and compared them. After presenting the survey, and result analysis and general comparison, we followed an ontologies’ comparison method called OntoMetric for further evaluation of the current SEGs’ ontologies. Our research results revealed that SEGs’ ontologies in the literature have two main diverse perspectives. One perspective intensively focuses on the game domain concepts, and the other perspective focuses on the pedagogic domain concepts. In addition, there is little proof that a comprehensive web-based SEGs ontology, which is characterized by completion, consistency, and reusability exists.},

While the experimental psychology and cognitive neuroscience literature may refer to certain behavioral tasks by name (e.g., the Stroop paradigm or the Sternberg paradigm) or by function (a working memory task, a visual attention task), these paradigms can vary tremendously in the stimuli that are presented to the subject, the response expected from the subject, and the instructions given to the subject. Drawing from the taxonomy developed and used by the BrainMap project (                            www.brainmap.org                                                     ) for almost two decades to describe key components of published functional imaging results, we have developed an ontology capable of representing certain characteristics of the cognitive paradigms used in the fMRI and PET literature. The Cognitive Paradigm Ontology is being developed to be compliant with the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), and to harmonize where possible with larger ontologies such as RadLex, NeuroLex, or the Ontology of Biomedical Investigations (OBI). The key components of CogPO include the representation of experimental conditions focused on the stimuli presented, the instructions given, and the responses requested. The use of alternate and even competitive terminologies can often impede scientific discoveries. Categorization of paradigms according to stimulus, response, and instruction has been shown to allow advanced data retrieval techniques by searching for similarities and contrasts across multiple paradigm levels. The goal of CogPO is to develop, evaluate, and distribute a domain ontology of cognitive paradigms for application and use in the functional neuroimaging community.},

Semantic web technologies are in the background of the entire adaptive system. In order to examine the effectiveness of the proposed model and students' feedback, an evaluation study was conducted on two groups of students.

But as the world of business becomes more interconnected and global, enterprise data is no long a monolith; it is just a part of a vast web of data. Managing data on a world-wide scale is a key capability for any business today. The Semantic Web treats data as a distributed resource on the scale of the World Wide Web, and incorporates features to address the challenges of massive data distribution as part of its basic design. The aim of the first two editions was to motivate the Semantic Web technology stack from end-to-end; to describe not only what the Semantic Web standards are and how they work, but also what their goals are and why they were designed as they are. It tells a coherent story from beginning to end of how the standards work to manage a world-wide distributed web of knowledge in a meaningful way. The third edition builds on this foundation to bring Semantic Web practice to enterprise. Fabien Gandon joins Dean Allemang and Jim Hendler, bringing with him years of experience in global linked data, to open up the story to a modern view of global linked data. While the overall story is the same, the examples have been brought up to date and applied in a modern setting, where enterprise and global data come together as a living, linked network of data. Also included with the third edition, all of the data sets and queries are available online for study and experimentation at data.world/swwo.},

Dempster–Shafer techniques originated in the work of Dempster on the use of probabilities with upper and lower bounds. They have subsequently been popularised in the literature on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Expert Systems, with particular emphasis placed on combining evidence from different sources. In the paper we introduce the basic concepts of the DST of evidence, briefly mentioning its origins and comparisons with the more traditional Bayesian theory. Following this we discuss recent developments of this theory including analytical and application areas of interest. Finally we discuss developments via the use of an example incorporating DST with the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP).},

This study aims to identify artifactual affordances through the analysis of 15 participants’ engagement in the CreaCube task. In this playful problem-solving activity, based on the use of modular robotics, players need to manipulate and assemble robotic cubes in order to create independently moving vehicles.

Offering a thorough description of cooperative learning and the research behind it, the authors explain how cooperative learning can be implemented in the classroom and why cooperation must pervade schooling at every level. They discuss not only formal cooperative learning but also informal cooperative learning, cooperative base groups, and cooperative structures. They emphasize that cooperation is more than a seating arrangement, that educators must attend to these essential components:  * Positive interdependence * Individual accountability/personal responsibility * Face-to-face promotive interaction * Interpersonal and small-group skills * Group processing Conflict is inevitable in any environment, and the authors provide succinct advice on managing conflict to creative a cooperative environment, structuring academic controversies, teaching procedures and skills, structuring a peacemaking program, teaching negotiation/mediation procedures and skills, and arbitrating as a last resort. If you want a successful learning community where people support each other's efforts and treat one another with respect, helping students develop their cooperative learning skills should be a key part of your strategy--and with this book you can start doing that.},

When improving creative climates in work settings, it is necessary to have a better understanding of the various mechanisms of creativity and what strengthens or diminishes them. Design/methodology/approach ‐ Creativity research is fragmented and involves multiple aspects, levels and disciplines, ranging from biology to psychology and sociology. Concepts from systems science have particular value in understanding creativity, as they provide a transdisciplinary language of how systems work and adapt. This conceptual paper makes use of the language and concepts from the systems field to connect often disparate perspectives and clarify key mechanisms of creativity. Findings ‐ The core of this paper is a newly developed multilevel model of the creative mind. The proposed concepts provide a starting point for integrating further theoretical findings. Practical implications ‐ Improved understanding of creativity could help leaders more effectively use their creativity while facilitating the creativity of others for successful cooperation and problem-solving. Originality/value ‐ The visual models introduced here help bridge theory and practice while creating a stronger link between creativity research and studies in systems, cybernetics and complexity.},

According to the theory, individuals who are unfamiliar with the probability calculus can infer the probabilities of events in an extensional way: They construct mental models of what is true in the various possibilities. Each model represents an equiprobable alternative unless individuals have beliefs to the contrary, in which case some models will have higher probabilities than others. The probability of an event depends on the proportion of models in which it occurs. The theory predicts several phenomena of reasoning about absolute probabilities, including typical biases. It correctly predicts certain cognitive illusions in inferences about relative probabilities. It accommodates reasoning based on numerical premises, and it explains how naive reasoners can infer posterior probabilities without relying on Bayes's theorem. Finally, it dispels some common misconceptions of probabilistic reasoning.},

We show how a close examination of a very general task (strategic planning) leads to a catalog of the concepts and facts that must be encoded for general commonsense reasoning. These concepts are sorted into a manageable number of coherent domains, one of which is the representational area of commonsense human memory. We then elaborate on these concepts using textual corpus-analysis techniques, where the conceptual distinctions made in natural language are used to improve the definitions of the concepts that should be expressible in our formal theories. These representational areas are then analyzed using more traditional knowledge representation techniques, as demonstrated in this article by our treatment of commonsense human memory.},

Participants more frequently endorsed conclusions as possible than as necessary, and differences in response to the 2 forms of instruction conformed to several predictions derived from the mental model theory of deduction. Findings of Experiments 2 and 3 showed that some fallacies are consistently endorsed and others consistently resisted when people are asked to judge whether conclusions that are only possible follow necessarily. This finding was accounted for by the computational implementation of the model theory: Fallacies are made when the first mental model of the premises considered supports the conclusion presented.

We present a psychological theory in which it is the foundation of human reasoning. The theory explains how possibilities have distinct interpretations (deontic, epistemic, and alethic), how people represent them in models, and how these models yield inferences. Key principles are that the semantics of possibilities are the same finitary alternatives underlying probabilities, that speech acts can create obligations inexpressible as probabilities, that compound assertions – conditionals and disjunctions – refer to conjunctions of possibilities holding in default of knowledge to the contrary, and that mental models condense multiple consistent possibilities into one. The theory is incompatible with all normal modal logics and with probabilistic logic. Yet, experiments have corroborated its predictions.

It postulates that the core meanings of causal assertions are deterministic and refer to temporally-ordered sets of possibilities: A causes B to occur means that given A, B occurs, whereas A enables B to occur means that given A, it is possible for B to occur. The paper shows how mental models represent such assertions, and how these models underlie deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning yielding explanations. It reviews evidence both to corroborate the theory and to account for phenomena sometimes taken to be incompatible with it. Finally, it reviews neuroscience evidence indicating that mental models for causal inference are implemented within lateral prefrontal cortex.},

	abstract = {We describe a dual‐process theory of how individuals estimate the probabilities of unique events, such as Hillary Clinton becoming U.S. President. It postulates that uncertainty is a guide to improbability. In its computer implementation, an intuitive system 1 simulates evidence in mental models and forms analog non‐numerical representations of the magnitude of degrees of belief. This system has minimal computational power and combines evidence using a small repertoire of primitive operations. It resolves the uncertainty of divergent evidence for single events, for conjunctions of events, and for inclusive disjunctions of events, by taking a primitive average of non‐numerical probabilities. It computes conditional probabilities in a tractable way, treating the given event as evidence that may be relevant to the probability of the dependent event. A deliberative system 2 maps the resulting representations into numerical probabilities. With access to working memory, it carries out arithmetical operations in combining numerical estimates. Experiments corroborated the theory's predictions. Participants concurred in estimates of real possibilities. They violated the complete joint probability distribution in the predicted ways, when they made estimates about conjunctions: P(A), P(B), P(A and B), disjunctions: P(A), P(B), P(A or B or both), and conditional probabilities P(A), P(B), P(B{\textbar}A). They were faster to estimate the probabilities of compound propositions when they had already estimated the probabilities of each of their components. We discuss the implications of these results for theories of probabilistic reasoning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {There has been much discussion recently about the scope and limits of purely symbolic models of the mind and about the proper role of connectionism in cognitive modeling. This paper describes the “symbol grounding problem”: How can the semantic interpretation of a formal symbol system be made intrinsic to the system, rather than just parasitic on the meanings in our heads? How can the meanings of the meaningless symbol tokens, manipulated solely on the basis of their (arbitrary) shapes, be grounded in anything but other meaningless symbols? The problem is analogous to trying to learn Chinese from a Chinese/Chinese dictionary alone. A candidate solution is sketched: Symbolic representations must be grounded bottom-up in nonsymbolic representations of two kinds: (1) iconic representations, which are analogs of the proximal sensory projections of distal objects and events, and (2) categorical representations, which are learned and innate feature detectors that pick out the invariant features of object and event categories from their sensory projections. Elementary symbols are the names of these object and event categories, assigned on the basis of their (nonsymbolic) categorical representations. Higher-order (3) symbolic representations, grounded in these elementary symbols, consist of symbol strings describing category membership relations (e.g. “An X is a Y that is Z”). Connectionism is one natural candidate for the mechanism that learns the invariant features underlying categorical representations, thereby connecting names to the proximal projections of the distal objects they stand for. In this way connectionism can be seen as a complementary component in a hybrid nonsymbolic/symbolic model of the mind, rather than a rival to purely symbolic modeling. Such a hybrid model would not have an autonomous symbolic “module,” however; the symbolic functions would emerge as an intrinsically “dedicated” symbol system as a consequence of the bottom-up grounding of categories' names in their sensory representations. Symbol manipulation would be governed not just by the arbitrary shapes of the symbol tokens, but by the nonarbitrary shapes of the icons and category invariants in which they are grounded.},

Notwithstanding decades of neuropsychological and neuroimaging work on the cognitive and neural substrate of semantic representations, many questions are left unanswered. The research in this dissertation attempts to unravel one of them: are the neural substrates of different components of concrete word meaning dissociated? In the first part, I review the different theoretical positions and empirical findings on the cognitive and neural correlates of semantic representations. Crucially, I propose an operational distinction between motor-perceptual dimensions (i.e., those attributes of the objects referred to by the words that are perceived through the senses) and conceptual ones (i.e., the information that is built via a complex integration of multiple perceptual features). In the second part, I present the results of the studies I conducted in order to investigate the automaticity of retrieval, topographical organization, and temporal dynamics of motor-perceptual and conceptual dimensions of word meaning. The results suggest that the neural substrates of different components of symbol meaning can be dissociated in terms of localization and of the feature of the signal encoding them, while sharing a similar temporal evolution.},

Among the significant issues that arise when setting up a learning network is the question of how to support communication between repositories that employ different schemes for describing learner profiles. To guarantee correct interpretation, a semantic common metadata schema is required. This paper aims to propose an ontological structure for representing a learner profile that augments it with semantics and provides a common vocabulary for the exchange of the different learner's characteristics that can be presented in a learner model. The proposed structure is based on different learner information with respect to well-known learner model specifications. Besides, it reuses terms from well-developed Semantic Web vocabularies which make it semantic web compliant and integrates different domain taxonomies and subject taxonomies that are used as ranges for particular concepts' slots.},

Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current engineering trends in both what they learn and how they learn it. Speciﬁcally, we argue that these machines should (1) build causal models of the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely solving pattern recognition problems; (2) ground learning in intuitive theories of physics and psychology to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned; and (3) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations. We suggest concrete challenges and promising routes toward these goals that can combine the strengths of recent neural network advances with more structured cognitive models.},

Affordances on the other hand, provide symbolic grounding mechanisms that enable linking features obtained from visual perception with the functionality of the objects, which provides the most consistent and holistic characterization of an object. Recognition by Component Affordances (RBCA) is a recent theory that builds affordance features for recognition. As an extension of the psychophysical theory of Recognition by Components (RBC) to generic visual perception, RBCA is well suited for cognitive visual processing systems which are required to perform implicit cognitive tasks. A common task is to substitute a cup for a mug, bottle, jug, pitcher, pilsner, beaker, chalice, goblet or any other unlabeled object, but with a physical part affording the ability to hold liquid and a part affording grasping by a human hand, given the goal of ’finding an empty cup’ and no cups are available in the work environment of interest. In this paper, we present affordance features for recognition of objects. Using a set of 25 structural and 10 material affordances we define a database of over 250 common household objects. This database called the Affordance Network or AfNet is available as community development framework and is well suited for deployment on domestic robots. Sample object recognition results using AfNet and the associated inference engine that grounds the affordances through visual perception features demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.},

	abstract = {Semantic cognition encompasses human performance based on knowledge about the properties of objects, relations among objects and word meanings. One approach to semantic cognition has arisen within the parallel distributed processing (PDP) framework, in which cognitive processes arise from interactions of neurons through synaptic connections. The knowledge that governs processing is stored in the strengths of the connections and is acquired gradually through experience, simulating conceptual development in childhood. These ideas have been explored in a simulated neural network model that learns propositions about objects and their properties. The model is trained with propositions about several different plant and animal concepts, including trees, flowers, fish, birds and land animals. The model contains 'hidden' units between its inputs and outputs, over which it learns internal representations that capture semantic relationships between concepts. Learning is influenced by coherent covariation of properties — that is, by co-occurrence of the same ensemble of properties (has wings, has feathers, can fly) in a number of different items (in this case, all the birds). The model explains the tendency towards progressive differentiation of concepts observed in development and the reverse fine-to-coarse deterioration observed in a progressive neuropathological condition called semantic dementia. With appropriate assumptions about covariation of properties, and about the relative frequencies of concepts and of the words used to name them, the model also addresses many further findings in development, dementia and normal adult cognition. Like other, similarity-based theories, the model accounts for the influence of graded category membership on semantic task performance, and for frequency and typicality effects. It also provides a means of addressing some of the criticisms of these other theories. Specifically, it indicates how some properties of objects, including causal properties, come to be more important than other properties; why some groups of items seem to form natural or coherent categories; how domain-specific patterns of generalization and differentiation might arise; and how conceptual knowledge structures might reorganize over the course of development. The PDP approach might provide a mechanistic framework that can address many of the phenomena emphasized in an alternative approach based on naive domain theories specifying causal relations between objects and their properties. Some of the relevant phenomena have yet to be addressed by PDP models, leaving this as a task for the future.},

Recently, several powerful techniques for unsupervised representation learning have been demonstrated to give the state-of-the-art performance in downstream tasks such as vertex classification and edge prediction. These techniques rely on random walks performed on the graph in order to capture its structural properties. These structural properties are then encoded in the vector representation space. However, most contemporary representation learning methods only apply to static graphs while real-world graphs are often dynamic and change over time. Static representation learning methods are not able to update the vector representations when the graph changes; therefore, they must re-generate the vector representations on an updated static snapshot of the graph regardless of the extent of the change in the graph. In this work, we propose computationally efficient algorithms for vertex representation learning that extend random walk based methods to dynamic graphs. The computation complexity of our algorithms depends upon the extent and rate of changes (the number of edges changed per update) and on the density of the graph. We empirically evaluate our algorithms on real world datasets for downstream machine learning tasks of multi-class and multi-label vertex classification. The results show that our algorithms can achieve competitive results to the state-of-the-art methods while being computationally efficient.},

	abstract = {Knowledge graphs (KGs) have been widely used in the field of artificial intelligence, such as in information retrieval, natural language processing, recommendation systems, etc. However, the open nature of KGs often implies that they are incomplete, having self-defects. This creates the need to build a more complete knowledge graph for enhancing the practical utilization of KGs. Link prediction is a fundamental task in knowledge graph completion that utilizes existing relations to infer new relations so as to build a more complete knowledge graph. Numerous methods have been proposed to perform the link-prediction task based on various representation techniques. Among them, KG-embedding models have significantly advanced the state of the art in the past few years. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on KG-embedding models for link prediction in knowledge graphs. We first provide a theoretical analysis and comparison of existing methods proposed to date for generating KG embedding. Then, we investigate several representative models that are classified into five categories. Finally, we conducted experiments on two benchmark datasets to report comprehensive findings and provide some new insights into the strengths and weaknesses of existing models.},

We apply our framework to dynamically changing graphs, where the set of vertices is fixed while the set of edges changes in each round. For random walks on dynamic connected graphs for which the stationary distribution does not change over time, we show that their behaviour is in a certain sense similar to static graphs. For example, we show that the mixing and hitting times of any sequence of \$d\$-regular connected graphs is \$O(n{\textasciicircum}2)\$, generalising a well-known result for static graphs. We also provide refined bounds depending on the isoperimetric dimension of the graph, matching again known results for static graphs. Finally, we investigate properties of random walks on dynamic graphs that are not always connected: we relate their convergence to stationarity to the spectral properties of an average of transition matrices and provide some examples that demonstrate strong discrepancies between static and dynamic graphs.},

	abstract = {Cognitive load theory was introduced in the 1980s as an instructional design theory based on several uncontroversial aspects of human cognitive architecture. Our knowledge of many of the characteristics of working memory, long-term memory and the relations between them had been well-established for many decades prior to the introduction of the theory. Curiously, this knowledge had had a limited impact on the field of instructional design with most instructional design recommendations proceeding as though working memory and long-term memory did not exist. In contrast, cognitive load theory emphasised that all novel information first is processed by a capacity and duration limited working memory and then stored in an unlimited long-term memory for later use. Once information is stored in long-term memory, the capacity and duration limits of working memory disappear transforming our ability to function. By the late 1990s, sufficient data had been collected using the theory to warrant an extended analysis resulting in the publication of Sweller et al. (Educational Psychology Review, 10, 251–296, 1998). Extensive further theoretical and empirical work have been carried out since that time and this paper is an attempt to summarise the last 20 years of cognitive load theory and to sketch directions for future research.},

Cognitive load theory has been designed to provide guidelines intended to assist in the presentation of information in a manner that encourages learner activities that optimize intellectual performance. The theory assumes a limited capacity working memory that includes partially independent subcomponents to deal with auditory/verbal material and visual/2- or 3-dimensional information as well as an effectively unlimited long-term memory, holding schemas that vary in their degree of automation. These structures and functions of human cognitive architecture have been used to design a variety of novel instructional procedures based on the assumption that working memory load should be reduced and schema construction encouraged.

	abstract = {The frontal lobes subserve decision-making and executive control—that is, the selection and coordination of goal-directed behaviors. Current models of frontal executive function, however, do not explain human decision-making in everyday environments featuring uncertain, changing, and especially open-ended situations. Here, we propose a computational model of human executive function that clarifies this issue. Using behavioral experiments, we show that unlike others, the proposed model predicts human decisions and their variations across individuals in naturalistic situations. The model reveals that for driving action, the human frontal function monitors up to three/four concurrent behavioral strategies and infers online their ability to predict action outcomes: whenever one appears more reliable than unreliable, this strategy is chosen to guide the selection and learning of actions that maximize rewards. Otherwise, a new behavioral strategy is tentatively formed, partly from those stored in long-term memory, then probed, and if competitive confirmed to subsequently drive action. Thus, the human executive function has a monitoring capacity limited to three or four behavioral strategies. This limitation is compensated by the binary structure of executive control that in ambiguous and unknown situations promotes the exploration and creation of new behavioral strategies. The results support a model of human frontal function that integrates reasoning, learning, and creative abilities in the service of decision-making and adaptive behavior.},

We present here a computational theory describing the evolution of the prefrontal cortex from rodents to humans as gradually adding new inferential Bayesian capabilities for dealing with a computationally intractable decision problem: exploring and learning new behavioural strategies versus exploiting and adjusting previously learned ones through reinforcement learning (RL). We provide a principled account identifying three inferential steps optimizing this arbitration through the emergence of (i) factual reactive inferences in paralimbic prefrontal regions in rodents; (ii) factual proactive inferences in lateral prefrontal regions in primates and (iii) counterfactual reactive and proactive inferences in human frontopolar regions. The theory clarifies the integration of model-free and model-based RL through the notion of strategy creation. The theory also shows that counterfactual inferences in humans yield to the notion of hypothesis testing, a critical reasoning ability for approximating optimal adaptive processes and presumably endowing humans with a qualitative evolutionary advantage in adaptive behaviour.},

	abstract = {La mémoire de travail est un système cognitif essentiel à notre vie quotidienne. Elle nous permet de conserver momentanément des informations dans le but de réaliser une tâche cognitive. Une des caractéristiques principales de ce type de mémoire est d’être limitée en capacité. Les raisons de cette limitation sont largement débattues dans la littérature. Certains modèles considèrent qu'une cause principale de l'oubli en mémoire de travail est l'existence d'un déclin temporel passif de l'activation des représentations mnésiques alors que d'autres modèles supposent que les interférences entre les informations suffisent à expliquer la capacité limitée de cette mémoire. Deux modèles computationnels ont été proposés récemment (TBRS* et SOB-CS) et illustrent parfaitement ce débat. En effet, ils décrivent de manière très différente ce qui se passe au cours d’une tâche de mémoire de travail impliquant à la fois la mémorisation et le traitement d’informations. En plus de s'opposer sur les causes de l’oubli, ils proposent des processus de maintien en mémoire de travail distincts : le rafraîchissement des informations pertinentes selon TBRS* versus la suppression des informations non pertinentes selon SOB-CS. Les travaux de cette thèse se sont organisés autour de deux objectifs principaux. Premièrement, cette thèse a porté sur l’étude de ces deux modèles et leur mécanisme de maintien. Pour cela, nous avons réalisé des expériences comportementales utilisant la tâche d’empan complexe afin de tester des hypothèses précises de ces modèles. Deuxièmement, nous avons étudié, à l'aide des modèles computationnels, les causes des déficits de mémoire de travail observés chez les personnes âgées, dans le but, à long terme, de créer ou d'améliorer les outils de remédiation. Concernant le premier objectif, les différents résultats d’études ont montré une discordance entre le comportement humain et les simulations. En effet, TBRS* et SOB-CS ne permettent pas de reproduire un effet positif du nombre de distracteurs contrairement à ce qui a été observé expérimentalement. Nous proposons que cet effet positif, non prédit par les modèles, est relié à la mémorisation à long terme non prise en compte dans ces deux modèles. Concernant le deuxième objectif, les résultats comportementaux suggèrent que les personnes âgées auraient principalement des difficultés à rafraîchir les traces mnésiques et à stabiliser les informations à long terme au cours d’une tâche d’empan complexe. Dans l’ensemble, les résultats de cette thèse suggèrent d'approfondir les recherches concernant les liens entre les mécanismes de maintien en mémoire de travail et la mémorisation à long terme, par exemple en proposant un nouveau modèle computationnel permettant de rendre compte de nos résultats. Au-delà des avancées concernant la compréhension du fonctionnement de la mémoire de travail, cette thèse montre également que l’utilisation de modèles computationnels revêt un caractère particulièrement pertinent pour l'étude d'une théorie ainsi que pour la comparaison de différentes populations.},

Toutes les fonctions cognitives, qu'elles touchent principalement à l'individu ou à la relation de celui-ci avec son entourage, fournissent un champ d'application à la croyance.

Des constantes apparaissent dans la relation qu'entretient la croyance avec chacune des fonctions cognitives que les neurosciences ont mises à jour. Dans une perspective neurocognitive, la croyance pourrait assurer une fonction, celle de soulager l'activité mentale de la résolution de conflits internes. Suivant une hypothèse avancée, l'émergence de cette fonction aurait principalement répondu aux conflits qui naissent de l'état d'incertitude attaché à la conscience humaine.

	abstract = {In real-world applications, the effective integration of learning and reasoning in a cognitive agent model is a difficult task. However, such integration may lead to a better understanding, use and construction of more realistic models. Unfortunately, existing models are either oversimplified or require much processing time, which is unsuitable for online learning and reasoning. Currently, controlled environments like training simulators do not effectively integrate learning and reasoning. In particular, higher-order concepts and cognitive abilities have many unknown temporal relations with the data, making it impossible to represent such relationships by hand. We introduce a novel cognitive agent model and architecture for online learning and reasoning that seeks to effectively represent, learn and reason in complex training environments. The agent architecture of the model combines neural learning with symbolic knowledge representation. It is capable of learning new hypotheses from observed data, and infer new beliefs based on these hypotheses. Furthermore, it deals with uncertainty and errors in the data using a Bayesian inference model. The validation of the model on real-time simulations and the results presented here indicate the promise of the approach when performing online learning and reasoning in real-world scenarios, with possible applications in a range of areas.},

	abstract = {The brain is a complex system, due to the heterogeneity of its structure, the diversity of the functions in which it participates and to its reciprocal relationships with the body and the environment. A systemic description of the brain is presented here, as a contribution to developing a brain theory and as a general framework where specific models in computational neuroscience can be integrated and associated with global information flows and cognitive functions. In an enactive view, this framework integrates the fundamental organization of the brain in sensorimotor loops with the internal and the external worlds, answering four fundamental questions (what, why, where and how). Our survival-oriented definition of behavior gives a prominent role to pavlovian and instrumental conditioning, augmented during phylogeny by the specific contribution of other kinds of learning, related to semantic memory in the posterior cortex, episodic memory in the hippocampus and working memory in the frontal cortex. This framework highlights that responses can be prepared in different ways, from pavlovian reflexes and habitual behavior to deliberations for goal-directed planning and reasoning, and explains that these different kinds of responses coexist, collaborate and compete for the control of behavior. It also lays emphasis on the fact that cognition can be described as a dynamical system of interacting memories, some acting to provide information to others, to replace them when they are not efficient enough, or to help for their improvement. Describing the brain as an architecture of learning systems has also strong implications in Machine Learning. Our biologically informed view of pavlovian and instrumental conditioning can be very precious to revisit classical Reinforcement Learning and provide a basis to ensure really autonomous learning.},

	abstract = {Current advances in Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have achieved unprecedented impact across research communities and industry. Nevertheless, concerns about trust, safety, interpretability and accountability of AI were raised by inﬂuential thinkers. Many have identiﬁed the need for well-founded knowledge representation and reasoning to be integrated with deep learning and for sound explainability. Neural-symbolic computing has been an active area of research for many years seeking to bring together robust learning in neural networks with reasoning and explainability via symbolic representations for network models. In this paper, we relate recent and early research results in neurosymbolic AI with the objective of identifying the key ingredients of the next wave of AI systems. We focus on research that integrates in a principled way neural network-based learning with symbolic knowledge representation and logical reasoning. The insights provided by 20 years of neural-symbolic computing are shown to shed new light onto the increasingly prominent role of trust, safety, interpretability and accountability of AI. We also identify promising directions and challenges for the next decade of AI research from the perspective of neural-symbolic systems.},

	abstract = {Intrinsically motivated spontaneous exploration is a key enabler of autonomous lifelong learning in human children. It enables the discovery and acquisition of large repertoires of skills through self-generation, self-selection, self-ordering and self-experimentation of learning goals. We present an algorithmic approach called Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Processes (IMGEP) to enable similar properties of autonomous or self-supervised learning in machines. The IMGEP algorithmic architecture relies on several principles: 1) self-generation of goals, generalized as ﬁtness functions; 2) selection of goals based on intrinsic rewards; 3) exploration with incremental goal-parameterized policy search and exploitation of the gathered data with a batch learning algorithm; 4) systematic reuse of information acquired when targeting a goal for improving towards other goals. We present a particularly efﬁcient form of IMGEP, called Modular Population-Based IMGEP, that uses a population-based policy and an object-centered modularity in goals and mutations. We provide several implementations of this architecture and demonstrate their ability to automatically generate a learning curriculum within several experimental setups including a real humanoid robot that can explore multiple spaces of goals with several hundred continuous dimensions. While no particular target goal is provided to the system, this curriculum allows the discovery of skills that act as stepping stone for learning more complex skills, e.g. nested tool use. We show that learning diverse spaces of goals with intrinsic motivations is more efﬁcient for learning complex skills than only trying to directly learn these complex skills.},

This approach has been implemented into a computational tool for assisting designers in generating creative ideas during the early stages of design. The tool, called “the Retriever”, has been developed based on ontology by embracing the aspects of analogical reasoning. A case study has indicated that the tool can be effective and useful for idea generation.

Presupposing cognition as basis of behaviour, among the most prominent tools in the modelling of behaviour are computational-logic systems, connectionist models of cognition, and models of uncertainty. Recent studies in cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and psychology have produced a number of cognitive models of reasoning, learning, and language that are underpinned by computation. In addition, efforts in computer science research have led to the development of cognitive computational systems integrating machine learning and automated reasoning. Such systems have shown promise in a range of applications, including computational biology, fault diagnosis, training and assessment in simulators, and software verification. This joint survey reviews the personal ideas and views of several researchers on neural-symbolic learning and reasoning. The article is organised in three parts: Firstly, we frame the scope and goals of neural-symbolic computation and have a look at the theoretical foundations. We then proceed to describe the realisations of neural-symbolic computation, systems, and applications. Finally we present the challenges facing the area and avenues for further research.},

Knowledge Group Awareness (KGA) designates the intersubjective perception of teammates’ knowledge. The use of especially designed gaming interfaces allows KGA declaration and displaying support by the introduction of the KGA explicitness systems, called by some authors KGA tools (Buder, 2010).This paper aims to study whether a structured explicitness of the KGA could play a core role in facilitating and improving collaborative face to face GBL performances. The KGA is operationalized through the Feeling of Knowledge (FOK) declaration. The FOK refers to the feelings a student has regarding his/her knowledge for a specific subject (Hart, 1965), it is defined by the student using a Confidence Level (CL) based in a 3 level scale. We expect that the FOK declaration process will have a positive impact in the learning process based in the GBL task, both in individual and collaborative phases of the GBL activity proposed to the students. However, we expect better performances in collaborative settings with the explicitness of the KGA thanks to the socially shared metacognition process, developed through the displaying of the intersubjective FOK. For this purpose we designed a collaborative SG in the field of finance, introducing an ad hoc KGA explicitness system with the aim of supporting the students’ FOK declaration according to the 3 CL. The first is analyzing the impact of the declaration of the FOK in individual performance when playing alone. The second one is analyzing the influence of shared visualization of the intersubjective FOK in the individual and collaborative performances, according to the symmetry of knowledge between dyad members. This environment permits researchers study different variables in order to study four hypotheses on learner’s performances and changes in their Feeling of knowledge (FOK) accuracies during collaborative game experience.},

The results of two computational experiments show that optimal primary reward signals may yield both emergent intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. The evolutionary perspective and the associated optimal reward framework thus lead to the conclusion that there are no hard and fast features distinguishing intrinsic and extrinsic reward computationally. Rather, the directness of the relationship between rewarding behavior and evolutionary success varies along a continuum.},

Nous nous attardons sur les études examinant les relations qu’entretiennent ces différents aspects du comportement humain avec les fonctions exécutives et les structures frontales. Les résultats rapportés montrent que les liens potentiels entre la théorie de l’esprit et le fonctionnement exécutif font encore beaucoup débat, et que l’étude des relations entre théorie de l’esprit et lobe frontal mérite d’être affinée. Les lésions frontales perturbent le traitement des émotions, mais les relations entre perturbation des fonctions exécutives et troubles du traitement des émotions restent inexplorées. La métacognition a été peu étudiée chez les patients dysexécutifs par lésions frontales, si ce n’est au travers de quelques études sur la métamémoire qui montrent que les patients frontaux ont globalement tendance à surestimer leurs performances. Cette surestimation ne semble pas nécessairement procéder d’un déficit exécutif, d’une incapacité de jugement, ni d’une méconnaissance du fonctionnement mnésique normal et pathologique. Il ne s’agit pas non plus d’une difficulté d’utilisation de connaissances. De plus, les différentes mesures métamnésiques obtenues chez les patients frontaux corrèlent peu entre elles, indiquant qu’elles engagent probablement des processus du contrôle métamnésique relativement indépendants qu’il conviendrait de spécifier. Enfin, il faudra aussi vérifier, avec des malades porteurs de lésions frontales et/ou de syndromes dysexécutifs, les propositions théoriques les plus récentes voulant que les concepts de théorie de l’esprit et de métacognition soient finalement assez proches.},

	abstract = {This article outlines a framework of creativity based on functional neuroanatomy. Recent advances in the field of cognitive neuroscience have identified distinct brain circuits that are involved in specific higher brain functions. To date, these findings have not been applied to research on creativity. It is proposed that there are four basic types of creative insights, each mediated by a distinctive neural circuit. By definition, creative insights occur in consciousness. Given the view that the working memory buffer of the prefrontal cortex holds the content of consciousness, each of the four distinctive neural loops terminates there. When creativity is the result of deliberate control, as opposed to spontaneous generation, the prefrontal cortex also instigates the creative process. Both processing modes, deliberate and spontaneous, can guide neural computation in structures that contribute emotional content and in structures that provide cognitive analysis, yielding the four basic types of creativity. Supportive evidence from psychological, cognitive, and neuroscientific studies is presented and integrated in this article. The new theoretical framework systematizes the interaction between knowledge and creative thinking, and how the nature of this relationship changes as a function of domain and age. Implications for the arts and sciences are briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {Mirror neurons within a monkey's premotor area F5 fire not only when the monkey performs a certain class of actions but also when the monkey observes another monkey (or the experimenter) perform a similar action. It has thus been argued that these neurons are crucial for understanding of actions by others. We offer the hand-state hypothesis as a new explanation of the evolution of this capability: the basic functionality of the F5 mirror system is to elaborate the appropriate feedback – what we call the hand state– for opposition-space based control of manual grasping of an object. Given this functionality, the social role of the F5 mirror system in understanding the actions of others may be seen as an exaptation gained by generalizing from one's own hand to an other's hand. In other words, mirror neurons first evolved to augment the “canonical” F5 neurons (active during self-movement based on observation of an object) by providing visual feedback on “hand state,” relating the shape of the hand to the shape of the object. We then introduce the MNS1 (mirror neuron system 1) model of F5 and related brain regions. The existing Fagg–Arbib–Rizzolatti–Sakata model represents circuitry for visually guided grasping of objects, linking the anterior intraparietal area (AIP) with F5 canonical neurons. The MNS1 model extends the AIP visual pathway by also modeling pathways, directed toward F5 mirror neurons, which match arm–hand trajectories to the affordances and location of a potential target object. We present the basic schemas for the MNS1 model, then aggregate them into three “grand schemas”– visual analysis of hand state, reach and grasp, and the core mirror circuit – for each of which we present a useful implementation (a non-neural visual processing system, a multijoint 3-D kinematics simulator, and a learning neural network, respectively). With this implementation we show how the mirror system may  learnto recognize actions already in the repertoire of the F5 canonical neurons. We show that the connectivity pattern of mirror neuron circuitry can be established through training, and that the resultant network can exhibit a range of novel, physiologically interesting behaviors during the process of action recognition. We train the system on the basis of final grasp but then observe the whole time course of mirror neuron activity, yielding predictions for neurophysiological experiments under conditions of spatial perturbation, altered kinematics, and ambiguous grasp execution which highlight the importance of the  timingof mirror neuron activity.},

	abstract = {Destiné aux étudiants en formation initiale à l’enseignement et aux enseignants, l'ouvrage explique de quelle manière les neurosciences peuvent éclairer l’apprentissage et soutenir l’élaboration de stratégies pédagogiques et orthopédagogiques adaptées. 
Dans cet ouvrage, les trois auteures, formatrices d’enseignants, conjuguent leur expertise pour examiner de quelle manière les neurosciences peuvent éclairer l’apprentissage et soutenir l’élaboration de stratégies pédagogiques et orthopédagogiques adaptées. Elles proposent des réponses ou, mieux dit, des hypothèses de travail aux questions que se posent formateurs et enseignants dans l’exercice de leur métier.
À cette fin, ce livre, dont le lecteur est le héros, offre à tout moment la latitude de choisir où se rendre. Si le lecteur souhaite examiner sa pratique en posture « méta », il sera intéressé par le profil apprenant présenté dans la première partie. S’il se demande ce qu’il doit comprendre quand l’autre ne comprend pas, la deuxième partie lui offrira de nombreuses pistes. S’il cherche quelle approche privilégier en individuel ou en collectif, il lira les coins de l’intervention. S’il veut savoir comment les neurosciences aident à comprendre pourquoi certaines stratégies marchent mieux que d’autres, il lira les coins de la réflexion. Enfin, s’il se demande comment raconter le fonctionnement du cerveau à ses élèves, il choisira les coins de l’expérimentation.
Ce livre s’adresse à tout enseignant qui souhaite retrouver le plaisir d’exercer ce métier impossible, comme Freud se plaisait à le qualifier. Il s’adresse aussi à tout formateur d’enseignants qui souhaite instaurer une culture enseignante fondée sur le plaisir d’apprendre à apprendre toute la vie.},

	abstract = {Résumé
Dans la vie courante, le terme émotion désigne en premier lieu des phénomènes expérientiels qui sortent de l’ordinaire. En raison des mouvements de l’âme qui les caractérisent, Descartes a désigné ces phénomènes par le terme émotion, un mot qui à son époque signifiait émeute ou agitation. Aristote reconnaissait le même phénomène dans son emploi du mot kinèsis. En effet, les ressentis émotionnels sont des perceptions de l’engagement dynamique du corps dans l’interaction. Pourtant, la qualité cinesthésique des émotions a été délaissée par la plupart des théories psychologiques. Cet article présente les arguments plaidant en faveur d’un modèle perceptif de l’émotion qui défend l’idée que les émotions sont des attitudes corporelles exprimant la relation du sujet à l’objet émotionnel. Ces arguments sont basés sur les récentes avancées des sciences cognitives notamment en matière de cognition incarnée. Ce modèle perceptif décrit une séquence fonctionnelle du processus de l’émotion qui s’inscrit dans la perspective des théories multi-componentielles actuelles des émotions.},

L’exploration des perturbations des FE et leur description sémiologique dans divers contextes cliniques pédiatriques a également progressé, tandis que les outils d’évaluation se sont à la fois généralisés et diversifiés. Malgré ces progrès considérables, plusieurs insuffisances sont à signaler, que ce soit en termes de modélisation théorique du développement typique, d’expertise clinique ou d’évaluation.

Un certain nombre d’études ont mis en évidence des déficits importants de reconnaissance, d’identification, de discrimination ou d’appariement de certaines émotions dans différents syndromes démentiels. Cependant, ces atteintes ne sont pas homogènes entre toutes les démences ; elles peuvent, selon le cas, affecter une ou plusieurs émotions. Le degré de l’altération émotionnelle peut également varier d’une pathologie à l’autre.

	abstract = {Rethinking the Notion of Affordance in its Semiotic Dynamics. As far as semiotic and cognitive theories are concerned, new digital texts and objects emphasize the need to refocus on the intimate connection between user and his environment, considered as a space where cognition emerges, is deployed and manipulated through repeated interactions between subject’s body and the technological and cultural world which surrounds him. In this case, the concept of “affordance” assumes a more central importance. Originally developed in the framework of the Gestalt theory, the notion of Aufforderungscharackter was subsequently reworked and made famous through the notion of affordance integrated in the ecological approach to visual perception conceived by James Gibson. However, the concept has successively been integrated into a more binary conception of cognition, which seems to be responsible for the loss of much of its heuristic power. I intend to go back here to the genesis of the notion and propose a semiotic and dynamic reinterpretation of this concept, where affordances can be seen as dispositions to act and patterns of expectation that are, from the beginning, intrinsically linked to the social and cultural dimensions of the human world. I will show how semiotic activity cannot take place in an infinitely brief presenttime, but needs to be comprehended into a more systemic approach to cognition, where the environment and the subject cannot be considered on the basis of a binary distinction, and where an intrinsically cultural microgenetic activity of perception and cognition is seen as necessary for the emergence of possibilities of action in material and digital objects. In this context, affordances may be explained as responses to a conceivable practical action made possible by habits that subjects consider on the basis of their inclusion into a system of practices and knowledge which foreshadows a specific and situated horizon of action.},

In the area of CT for young learners, educators are experimenting with digital or digital-inspired methods to go beyond digital literacy, towards also improving other skills, such as problem-solving, logical thinking and abstraction. By improving these skills, we aim to empower learners with the required knowledge as technology users and to aid in mastering the technology to develop their creative and citizenship potential through them. This chapter will provide a literature review on studies conducted to teach computer programming and computational concepts to K-12 students using visual programming tools, unplugged activities and educational robotics while evaluating how it can also help improve CT skills.},

	abstract = {Semantic Image Interpretation (SII) is the task of extracting structured semantic descriptions from images. It is widely agreed that the combined use of visual data and background knowledge is of great importance for SII. Recently, Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) approaches have been developed for reasoning under uncertainty and learning in the presence of data and rich knowledge. Logic Tensor Networks (LTNs) are a SRL framework which integrates neural networks with ﬁrst-order fuzzy logic to allow (i) efﬁcient learning from noisy data in the presence of logical constraints, and (ii) reasoning with logical formulas describing general properties of the data. In this paper, we develop and apply LTNs to two of the main tasks of SII, namely, the classiﬁcation of an image’s bounding boxes and the detection of the relevant part-of relations between objects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst successful application of SRL to such SII tasks. The proposed approach is evaluated on a standard image processing benchmark. Experiments show that background knowledge in the form of logical constraints can improve the performance of purely data-driven approaches, including the state-of-theart Fast Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (Fast R-CNN). Moreover, we show that the use of logical background knowledge adds robustness to the learning system when errors are present in the labels of the training data.},

The model allows for the encoding of past and future temporal logic operators in neural networks, through a neural-symbolic translation algorithms introduced in the paper. The networks are relatively simple and can be used for reasoning about time and for learning by examples with the use of standard neural learning algorithms. We validate the model in a well-known application dealing WIth temporal synchronisation in distributed knowledge systems.

By contrast, standard cognitive neuroscience typically uses the concept to refer to (action-oriented) representations in the brain. This paper will show that the view of affordances as representations firmly places the concept in the subject-object framework that dominates both psychology and neuroscience. Notably, Gibson introduced the affordance concept to overcome this very framework. We describe an account of the role of the brain in perception and action that is consistent with Gibson. Making use of neuroscientific findings of neural reuse, degeneracy and functional connectivity, we conceptualize neural regions in the brain as dispositional parts of perceptual and action systems that temporarily assemble to enable animals to directly perceive and - in the paradigmatic case - utilize the affordances of the environment.},

When an inference rule is selected, it commands the thalamus to modify and transmit information between areas of the cortex. The system supports special-case and general-purpose inferences, including the ability to remember complex statements and answer questions about them.

	abstract = {The paper investigates the nature of the articulatory code (AC), which
contains the messages needed for cortical processing to perceive and produce
speech. The paper claims that the AC is a multi-item neural code identical for
both modalities - speech perception and speech production - and that the
transport of the AC between the short-term memory and the speech processing
areas is performed by coupled Ɵ/ɤ-oscillations. Due to the limitation given by the
state of the art in measuring cortical activities, the structure and content of the
AC is not deciphered yet. Using findings from research in phonetics and evolution
and using invasive as well as non-invasive measurements of cortical activities
of non-human and human primates, the paper is focused to verify the hypothesis,
that each message of the AC describes the structure and content of a Ɵsyllable.
The items of each message represent elementary articulatory gestures
composing syllables and are coded based on bundles of manner \& place like articulatory
features. Further the items are generated by spike patterns of neurons
connected to complexes of neurons sensitive to articulatory features and are
transmitted by modulated ɤ-oscillations embedded in the Ɵ-oscillations. A final
proof derived from cortical measurement for the proposed AC is still missing.
Thus, there is a need for further cortical measurements.},

	abstract = {This work is realized within the scope of a general attempt to understand parametric adaptation, regarding visual perception. The key idea is to analyze how we may use multi-model parametric estimation as a 1st step towards categorization. More generally, the goal is to formalize how the notion of ``objects'' or ``events'' in an application may be reduced to a choice in a hierarchy of parametric models used to estimate the underlying data categorization. These mechanisms are to be linked with what occurs in the cerebral cortex where object recognition corresponds to a parametric neuronal estimation (see for instanced Page 2000 for a discussion and Freedman et al 2001 for an example regarding the primate visual cortex). We thus hope to bring here an algorithmic element in relation with the ``grand-ma'' neuron modelization. We thus revisit the problem of parameter estimation in computer vision, presented here as a simple optimization problem, considering (i) non-linear implicit measurement equations and parameter constraints, plus (ii) robust estimation in the presence of outliers and (iii) multi-model comparisons. Here, (1) a projection algorithm based on generalizations of square-root decompositions allows an efficient and numerically stable local resolution of a set of non-linear equations. On the other hand, (2) a robust estimation module of a hierarchy of non-linear models has been designed and validated. A step ahead, the software architecture of the estimation module is discussed with the goal of being integrated in reactive software environments or within applications with time constraints.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.00265},
	abstract = {Due to their capacity to encode rich structural information, labeled graphs are often used for modeling various kinds of objects such as images, molecules, and chemical compounds. If pattern recognition problems such as clustering and classification are to be solved on these domains, a (dis-)similarity measure for labeled graphs has to be defined. A widely used measure is the graph edit distance (GED), which, intuitively, is defined as the minimum amount of distortion that has to be applied to a source graph in order to transform it into a target graph. The main advantage of GED is its flexibility and sensitivity to small differences between the input graphs. Its main drawback is that it is hard to compute. In this thesis, new results and techniques for several aspects of computing GED are presented. Firstly, theoretical aspects are discussed: competing definitions of GED are harmonized, the problem of computing GED is characterized in terms of complexity, and several reductions from GED to the quadratic assignment problem (QAP) are presented. Secondly, solvers for the linear sum assignment problem with error-correction (LSAPE) are discussed. LSAPE is a generalization of the well-known linear sum assignment problem (LSAP), and has to be solved as a subproblem by many GED algorithms. In particular, a new solver is presented that efficiently reduces LSAPE to LSAP. Thirdly, exact algorithms for computing GED are presented in a systematic way, and improvements of existing algorithms as well as a new mixed integer programming (MIP) based approach are introduced. Fourthly, a detailed overview of heuristic algorithms that approximate GED via upper and lower bounds is provided, and eight new heuristics are described. Finally, a new easily extensible C++ library for exactly or approximately computing GED is presented.},

	title = {Nonholonomic {Path} {Planning} {Using} {Harmonic} {Functions}},
	abstract = {A method is presented for planning obstacle-avoiding paths for a system which exhibits nonholonomic constraints. The method is based on the use of harmonic functions. Linear constraints on the velocity of a nonholonomic system can be directly expressed as Neumann boundary conditions for a harmonic function. Such boundary conditions are easily represented in a resistive network. The resulting potential represents an integration of nonholonomic constraints over an admissible subset of configuration space. The method is applied to path planning for simple wheeled vehicles. 1 Introduction This paper draws on the relationship between harmonic functions and resistive networks to propose a new method for planning the motion of nonholonomic systems. Simple nonholonomic constraints [1] restrict the velocity of mechanical systems to a linear subspace of their configuration space. These constraints bear a resemblance to the Neumann boundary condition for harmonic functions. Although nonho...},

	abstract = {The discrepancy between syntax and semantics is a painstaking issue that hinders a better comprehension of the underlying neuronal processes in the human brain. In order to tackle the issue, we at first describe a striking correlation between Wittgenstein's Tractatus, that assesses the syntactic relationships between language and world, and Perlovsky's joint language-cognitive computational model, that assesses the semantic relationships between emotions and "knowledge instinct". Once established a correlation between a purely logical approach to the language and computable psychological activities, we aim to find the neural correlates of syntax and semantics in the human brain. Starting from topological arguments, we suggest that the semantic properties of a proposition are processed in higher brain's functional dimensions than the syntactic ones. In a fully reversible process, the syntactic elements embedded in Broca's area project into multiple scattered semantic cortical zones. The presence of higher functional dimensions gives rise to the increase in informational content that takes place in semantic expressions. Therefore, diverse features of human language and cognitive world can be assessed in terms of both the logic armor described by the Tractatus, and the neurocomputational techniques at hand. One of our motivations is to build a neuro-computational framework able to provide a feasible explanation for brain's semantic processing, in preparation for novel computers with nodes built into higher dimensions.},

While state-of-the-art learning from data typically use sub-symbolic distributed representations, reasoning is normally useful at a higher level of abstraction with the use of a ﬁrst-order logic language for knowledge representation. As a result, attempts at combining symbolic AI and neural computation into neural-symbolic systems have been on the increase. In this paper, we present Logic Tensor Networks (LTN), a neurosymbolic formalism and computational model that supports learning and reasoning through the introduction of a many-valued, end-to-end diﬀerentiable ﬁrst-order logic called Real Logic as a representation language for deep learning. We show that LTN provides a uniform language for the speciﬁcation and the computation of several AI tasks such as data clustering, multi-label classiﬁcation, relational learning, query answering, semi-supervised learning, regression and embedding learning. We implement and illustrate each of the above tasks with a number of simple explanatory examples using TensorFlow 2. Keywords: Neurosymbolic AI, Deep Learning and Reasoning, Many-valued Logic.},

In their research, they have found consistently that standard educational practices that do not lead learners to grasp the meaning of tasks usually fail to give them confidence in their abilities.

	abstract = {concrete. In the simplest case, an object moving on a computer screen might be defined by the most formal of rules and so be like a construct in pure mathematics; but at the same time it is visible, almost tangible, and allows a sense of direct manipulation that only the encultured mathematician can feel in traditional formal systems (see Davis \& Hersh, 1981; Papert, 1980a). The computer has a theoretical vocation: to bring the philosophical down to earth. 4 While many can empathize when Carol Gilligan describes people making "contextual" moral decisions (you can cast yourself and acquaintances in the different roles) there is more of a problem when people try to get close to what it feels like to do science in a style that rejects standard notions of "objectivity." 5 Evelyn Fox Keller, describing such a style in the work of geneticist Barbara McClintock, notes that this is the "less accessible aspect" of a scientist's relationship to nature (Keller, 1985). We believe she is right. A personal appropriation of epistemological pluralism in science requires, at the limit, that we get close to the experiences of an Einstein or a McClintock or a Salk. But you can imagine yourself in the place of a programmer more easily than in the place of an Einstein. And when you yourself program (an activity within the reach of everyone), you can experience the degree to which your style of solving logical problems is very much your own. In this chapter, we use the computer as an instrument for observing different styles of scientific thought and developing categories for analyzing them. 6 We find that, besides being a lens through which personal styles can be seen, it is also a privileged medium for the growth of alternative voices in dealing with the world of formal systems. After presenting cases in which the computer serves as an expressive medium for personal styles, we turn to this more speculative theme: As a carrier for pluralistic ideas, the computer holds the promise of catalyzing change, not only within computation but in our culture at large.},

We examine group creative activity broadly, ranging from the micro-level co-construction of novel resources for team problem solving to the evolutionary reuse of ideas and solution strategies across teams. Our analysis focuses on describing the relationship between the dynamics of creative work present in a single collaborative episode of an online group and their evolution across time and across collectivities. Our analysis indicates that the synergy between these two types of interactions and the resulting creative engagement of the teams relies on three fundamental processes: (a) indexical referencing, (b) group remembering, and (c) bridging across discontinuities.},

Two empirical snapshots are presented to exemplify the use of Galperin’s theory to design assignments and modules in digital learning environments.

Yet scientific understanding of creative processes is quite limited, mostly due to the traditional belief that considers creativity as a mysterious puzzle, a paradox, defying empirical enquiry. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in revealing the neural correlates of human creativity. Though many of these studies, pioneering in nature, help demystification of creativity, but the field is still dominated by popular beliefs in associating creativity with “right brain thinking”, “divergent thinking”, “altered states” and so on (Dietrich and Kanso, 2010). In this article, we discuss a computational framework for creativity based on Baars’ Global Workspace Theory (GWT; Baars, 1988) enhanced with mechanisms based on information theory. Next we propose a neurocognitive architecture of creativity with a strong focus on various facets (i.e., unconscious thought theory, mind wandering, spontaneous brain states) of un/pre-conscious brain responses. Our principal argument is that pre-conscious creativity happens prior to conscious creativity and the proposed computational model may provide a mechanism by which this transition is managed. This integrative approach, albeit unconventional, will hopefully stimulate future neuroscientific studies of the inscrutable phenomenon of creativity.},

Recent work in humans and rodents suggests that the hippocampal system may be better understood as a system that facilitates predictions about upcoming events. The hippocampus and associated cortical structures are active when people envision future events, and damage that includes the hippocampal region impairs this ability. In rats, hippocampal ensembles preplay and replay event sequences in the absence of overt behavior. If strung together in novel combinations, these sequences could provide the neural building blocks for simulating upcoming events during decision-making, planning, and when imagining novel scenarios. Moreover, in both humans and rodents, the hippocampal system is spontaneously active during task-free epochs and sleep, further suggesting that the system may use idle moments to derive new representations that set the context for future behaviors.},

Expanding beyond this narrow view, we focus this review on pertinent questions and novel methodological advances for the multi-scale brain. We separate our exposition into content related to multi-scale topological structure, multi-scale temporal structure, and multi-scale spatial structure. In each case, we recount empirical evidence for such structures, survey network-based methodological approaches to reveal these structures, and outline current frontiers and open questions.

Interactions between these fields, as promoted through the common hub of RL, has facilitated paradigm shifts that relate multiple levels of analysis in a singular framework (for example, relating dopamine function to a computationally defined RL signal). Recently, more sophisticated RL algorithms have been proposed to better account for human learning, and in particular its oft-documented reliance on two separable systems: a model-based (MB) system and a model-free (MF) system. However, along with many benefits, this dichotomous lens can distort questions, and may contribute to an unnecessarily narrow perspective on learning and decision-making. Here, we outline some of the consequences that come from overconfidently mapping algorithms, such as MB versus MF RL, with putative cognitive processes. We argue that the field is well positioned to move beyond simplistic dichotomies, and we propose a means of refocusing research questions towards the rich and complex components that comprise learning and decision-making.},

	abstract = {Abstract This paper offers a conceptual framework which (re)integrates goal-directed control, motivational processes, and executive functions, and suggests a developmental pathway from situated action to higher level cognition. We first illustrate a basic computational (control-theoretic) model of goal-directed action that makes use of internal modeling. We then show that by adding the problem of selection among multiple action alternatives motivation enters the scene, and that the basic mechanisms of executive functions such as inhibition, the monitoring of progresses, and working memory, are required for this system to work. Further, we elaborate on the idea that the off-line re-enactment of anticipatory mechanisms used for action control gives rise to (embodied) mental simulations, and propose that thinking consists essentially in controlling mental simulations rather than directly controlling behavior and perceptions. We conclude by sketching an evolutionary perspective of this process, proposing that anticipation leveraged cognition, and by highlighting specific predictions of our model.},

Despite the important roles that OLMs play in higher education to support the learning process and self-regulated learning (SRL) in particular, there are few studies systematically reviewing OLM technology in higher education, and investigating their potential to foster selfregulated learning. Therefore, we carried out a systematic review of a 30-year sample of OLM studies in higher education and identified 64 articles that study the use of OLMs in supporting SRL. Our findings show that OLMs have been mainly used to support learners’ cognition and a bit less metacognition and motivation; however, emotional support has been rarely provided. The most supported ones are Appraisal and Performance phases; Preparation of learning is enhanced by OLMs not so often. Although learners can edit or negotiate with their learning model in advanced ways, a simple inspectable OLM is more preferred. Reliance on unobservable nodes is less favored in modeling techniques in OLMs because such methods are highly dependent on expert authoring, thereby time-intensive and costly. Comparison and color-coding are two mostused features in OLMs, where the comparison feature is often used for enhancing learners’ engagement and motivation.},

However, state-of-the-art embedding methods typically do not account for latent hierarchical structures which are characteristic for many complex symbolic datasets. In this work, we introduce a new approach for learning hierarchical representations of symbolic data by embedding them into hyperbolic space -- or more precisely into an n-dimensional Poincaré ball. Due to the underlying hyperbolic geometry, this allows us to learn parsimonious representations of symbolic data by simultaneously capturing hierarchy and similarity. We present an efficient algorithm to learn the embeddings based on Riemannian optimization and show experimentally that Poincaré embeddings can outperform Euclidean embeddings significantly on data with latent hierarchies, both in terms of representation capacity and in terms of generalization ability.},

Possibility theory lies at the crossroads between fuzzy sets, probability, and nonmonotonic reasoning. Possibility theory can be cast either in an ordinal or in a numerical setting. Qualitative possibility theory is closely related to belief revision theory, and commonsense reasoning with exception-tainted knowledge in artificial intelligence. Possibilistic logic provides a rich representation setting, which enables the handling of lower bounds of possibility theory measures, while remaining close to classical logic. Qualitative possibility theory has been axiomatically justified in a decision-theoretic framework in the style of Savage, thus providing a foundation for qualitative decision theory. Quantitative possibility theory is the simplest framework for statistical reasoning with imprecise probabilities. As such, it has close connections with random set theory and confidence intervals, and can provide a tool for uncertainty propagation with limited statistical or subjective information.},

However, very few attempts have been made to identify core computational principles underlying those hippocampal responses. Here, we capitalize on the observation that the entorhinal-hippocampal complex (EHC) forms a closed loop and projects inhibitory signals “countercurrent” to the trisynaptic pathway to build a self-supervised model that learns to reconstruct its own inputs by error backpropagation. The EHC is then abstracted as an autoencoder, with the hidden layers acting as an information bottleneck. With the inputs mimicking the firing activity of lateral and medial entorhinal cells, our model is shown to generate place cells and to respond to environmental manipulations as observed in rodent experiments. Altogether, we propose that the hippocampus builds conjunctive compressed representations of the environment by learning to reconstruct its own entorhinal inputs via gradient descent.},

	abstract = {Human episodic memories are (re)constructed, combining unique features with schema-based predictions, and share neural substrates with imagination. They also show systematic schema-based distortions that increase with consolidation. Here we present a computational model in which hippocampal replay (from an autoassociative network) trains generative models (variational autoencoders) in neocortex to (re)create sensory experiences via latent variable representations. Simulations using large image datasets reflect the effects of memory age and hippocampal lesions and the slow learning of statistical structure in agreement with previous models (Complementary Learning Systems and Multiple Trace Theory), but also explain schema-based distortions, imagination, inference, and continual representation learning in memory. Critically, the model suggests how unique and predictable elements of memories are stored and reconstructed by efficiently combining both hippocampal and neocortical systems, optimising the use of limited hippocampal storage. Finally, the model can be extended to sequential stimuli, including language, and multiple neocortical networks could be trained, including those with latent variable representations in entorhinal, medial prefrontal, and anterolateral temporal cortices. Overall, we believe hippocampal replay training neocortical generative models provides a comprehensive account of memory construction and consolidation.},

	url = {https://hal.science/hal-00186549},
	abstract = {The fact that it is very unlikely that a polynomial time algorithm could ever be devised for optimally solving NP-hard problems, strongly motivates both researchers and practitioners in trying to heuristically solving such problems, by making a trade-off between computational time and solution's quality. In other words, heuristic computation consists of trying to find in reasonable time, not the best solution but one solution which is “near” the optimal one. Among classes of heuristic methods for NP-hard problems, the polynomial approximation algorithms aim at solving a given NP-hard problem in polynomial time by computing feasible solutions that are, under some predefined criterion, as near as possible to the optimal ones. The polynomial approximation theory deals with the study of such algorithms. This survey presents and analyzes in a first time approximation algorithms for some classical examples of NP-hard problems. In a second time, it shows how classical notions and tools of complexity theory, such as polynomial reductions, can be matched with polynomial approximation in order to devise structural results for NP-hard optimization problems. Finally, it presents a quick description of what it is commonly called inapproximability results. Such results provide limits on the approximability of the problems tackled.},

	abstract = {Mental and behavioral disorders represent a significant portion of the public health burden in all countries. The human cost of these disorders is immense, yet treatment options for sufferers are currently limited, with many patients failing to respond sufficiently to available interventions and drugs. High quality ontologies facilitate data aggregation and comparison across different disciplines, and may therefore speed up the translation of primary research into novel therapeutics. Realism-based ontologies describe entities in reality and the relationships between them in such a way that once formulated in a suitable formal language the ontologies can be used for sophisticated automated reasoning applications. Reference ontologies can be applied across different contexts in which different, and often mutually incompatible, domain-specific vocabularies have traditionally been used. In this contribution we describe the Mental Functioning Ontology (MF) and Mental Disease Ontology (MD), two realism-based ontologies currently under development for the description of human mental functioning and disease. We describe the structure and upper levels of the ontologies and preliminary application scenarios, and identify some open questions.},

In this essay, we suggest some refinements to Marr's distinctions using a population activity model of cortico-striatal circuitry exploring impulsivity and behavioral inhibition as a case study. In particular, we urge that Marr's computational level should be redefined to include a description of how systems break down. We also underscore that feed-forward processing, cognition disconnected from behavioral context, and representations do not always drive cognition in the way that Marr originally assumed.},

We review the application of the CLS framework to a range of important topics, including the following: the basic neural processes of hippocampal memory encoding and recall, conjunctive encoding, human recognition memory, consolidation of initial hippocampal learning in cortex, dynamic modulation of encoding versus recall, and the synergistic interactions between hippocampus and neocortex. Overall, the CLS framework remains a vital theoretical force in the field, with the empirical data over the past 15 years generally confirming its key principles.},

These skills are critical for success in all life's aspects and are sometimes more predictive than even IQ or socioeconomic status. Understandably, there is great interest in improving EFs. It's now clear they can be improved at any age through training and practice, much as physical exercise hones physical fitness. However, despite claims to the contrary, wide transfer does not seem to occur and ‘mindless’ aerobic exercise does little to improve EFs. Important questions remain: How much can EFs be improved (are benefits only superficial) and how long can benefits be sustained? What are the best methods for improving EFs? What about an approach accounts for its success? Do the answers to these differ by individual characteristics such as age or gender? Since stress, sadness, loneliness, or poor health impair EFs, and the reverse enhances EFs, we predict that besides directly train EFs, the most successful approaches for improving EFs will also address emotional, social, and physical needs.

The survey formally introduces the IRL problem along with its central challenges such as the diﬃculty in performing accurate inference and its generalizability, its sensitivity to prior knowledge, and the disproportionate growth in solution complexity with problem size. The article elaborates how the current methods mitigate these challenges. We further discuss the extensions to traditional IRL methods for handling: inaccurate and incomplete perception, an incomplete model, multiple reward functions, and nonlinear reward functions.

	abstract = {In high-dimensional data, clusters often exist in the form of complex hierarchical relationships. In order to explore these relationships, there is a need to integrate dimensionality reduction techniques with data mining approaches and graph theory. The correlations in data points emerge more clearly if this integration is flawless. We propose an approach called Local Graph Based Correlation Clustering (LGBACC). This approach merges hierarchical clustering, with PCA to uncover complex hierarchical relationships, and uses graph models to visualize the results. We propose a framework of this approach that is divided into four phases. Each phase is flawlessly integrated with the next phase. Visualization of data after each phase is an important output and is knitted into the fabric of the framework. The focus of this technique remains on obtaining high quality clusters. The quality of the final clusters obtained is measured using standard indices. It is found that LGBACC is better than the existing hierarchical clustering approaches. We have used real-world data sets to validate our framework. These datasets test the approach on low as well as high-dimensional data. It is found that LGBACC produces high-quality clusters across a wide spectrum of dimensionality. Scalability test on synthetically produced high-dimensional and large datasets show that the proposed approach runs efficiently. Hence, LGBACC is an efficient and scalable approach that produces high-quality clusters in high-dimensional and large data spaces.},

	abstract = {During the learning process, a child develops a mental representation of the task he or she is learning. A Machine Learning algorithm develops also a latent representation of the task it learns. We investigate the development of the knowledge construction of an artificial agent through the analysis of its behavior, i.e., its sequences of moves while learning to perform the Tower of Hanoï (TOH) task. The TOH is a well-known task in experimental contexts to study the problem-solving processes and one of the fundamental processes of children’s knowledge construction about their world. We position ourselves in the field of explainable reinforcement learning for developmental robotics, at the crossroads of cognitive modeling and explainable AI. Our main contribution proposes a 3-step methodology named Implicit Knowledge Extraction with eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (IKE-XAI) to extract the implicit knowledge, in form of an automaton, encoded by an artificial agent during its learning. We showcase this technique to solve and explain the TOH task when researchers have only access to moves that represent observational behavior as in human–machine interaction. Therefore, to extract the agent acquired knowledge at different stages of its training, our approach combines: first, a Q-learning agent that learns to perform the TOH task; second, a trained recurrent neural network that encodes an implicit representation of the TOH task; and third, an XAI process using a post-hoc implicit rule extraction algorithm to extract finite state automata. We propose using graph representations as visual and explicit explanations of the behavior of the Q-learning agent. Our experiments show that the IKE-XAI approach helps understanding the development of the Q-learning agent behavior by providing a global explanation of its knowledge evolution during learning. IKE-XAI also allows researchers to identify the agent’s Aha! moment by determining from what moment the knowledge representation stabilizes and the agent no longer learns.},

However, the result of translation may consist of a Datalog program and a set of constraints in the form of negative clauses. Therefore, a knowledge base in OWL 2RL may be unsatisfiable. In the current paper we first identify a maximal fragment of OWL 2RL, called OWL 2RL + , with the property that every knowledge base expressed in OWL2RL +  can be translated to a Datalog program and hence is satisfiable. We then propose some extensions of OWL 2RL and OWL 2RL +  that still have PTime data complexity.},

	abstract = {The function of a neuron can be described simultaneously at several levels of abstraction. For instance, a spike train represents the result of a computation done by a single neuron with its inputs, but it also represents the result of a complex function realized by the network in which the neuron is embedded. When models of large parts of the brain are considered, it may be desirable to use computational modules operating at a very abstract level. However, it is shown here that abstract neural functions depend on detailed features of the single neuron model used in the network reproducing the abstract function. Examples are given of the multiplicative function, motion detection, short-term memory and timing. All these operations rely on one or another feature of the extended Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neuron used in this paper, e.g., probabilistic synapses, post-synaptic currents modelled with alpha functions or partial reset of the somatic membrane. Consequently it is suggested that neural modelling at an abstract level does not obviate the need for a clear statement on the nature of the underlying model of biological neuron. In that sense, not many abstract functions are convincingly grounded, not even the standard formal neurons used in most artificial neural networks.},

We target the development of computational thinking (CT) competency, including the initiation to informatics (i.e., computer science and technology), with the goal to evaluate and analyze the development of CT. Collecting LA is mandatory in this case and if adaptive learning is targeted. While collecting LA during online interactions is rather straightforward, automatically collecting LA when manipulating tangible objects is more challenging, especially in a context where low-cost greenIT material is required. The key idea here, contrary to usual “black-box” systems working (more or less) automatically, is to change the learning paradigm and involve the learner in the data collection, making the process transparent and allowing her or him to also learn how to learn. This is particularly pertinent here since we use Informatics tools in order to … initiate to Informatics and CT. This means that we have to redesign the activity scenario including its didactic and revisit the underneath pedagogy, which turns to be an interesting and innovative challenge.},

	abstract = {Considering the biological or artificial control of a trajectory generation, we propose a biologically plausible model based on harmonic potentials. Such methods assume that obstacles to avoid (or constraints not to violate) correspond to maxima of the potential, while the goal corresponds to a unique minimum. The corresponding algorithm thus behaves as if one throws a sheet onto this state space, this hyper-surface relief being elevated on obstacles, with a hole at the goal location, so that finding a trajectory reduces to «roll down» along this relief towards the minimal height location. The originality of the present work is to build an harmonic potential (thus without local minimum) as a finite linear combination of elementary harmonic functions. The set of these components samples the border of the admissible domain bounded by obstacles or constraints. This leads to an internal representation of the problem as a non-topographical map increment- ally builded during the system exploration and non-linearly linked to the real problem geometry. As such, it provides a biologically plausible quantitative model of some hippocampus mechanisms and of the related cognitive maps, in coherence with usual biological assumptions about such behavior.},

The most pleasing feature of Green's account was the negligible gap between high-level logical specification and practical implementation. This paper attempts to reinstate the ideal of planning via theorem proving in a modern guise. In particular, the paper shows that if we adopt the event calculus as our logical formalism and employ abductive logic programming as our theorem proving technique, then the computation performed mirrors closely that of a hand-coded partial-order planning algorithm. Soundness and completeness results for this logic programming implementation are given. Finally the paper shows that, if we extend the event calculus in a natural way to accommodate compound actions, then using the same abductive theorem proving techniques we can obtain a hierarchical planner.},

	abstract = {Numbers can be used most flexibly to quantify and rank. Cardinal number refers to quantitative number assignments assessing set size (numerosity), whereas ordinal number applies to numerical rank that concerns serial order. Behavioural studies in animals, human infants and innumerate adults have demonstrated that numerical competence does not emerge de novo in linguistic humans, but builds up on biological precursor systems. Single-cell recordings in monkeys as well as functional imaging studies in humans showed that quantity information is represented in the posterior parietal cortex in close association with the prefrontal cortex. The response properties of numerosity-selective cortical cells can explain basic psychophysical phenomena, such as the numerical distance effect and the numerical size effect. In humans, the intra-parietal sulcus of the parietal lobe is specifically activated by non-verbal and verbal quantity information, independent of sensory modality, symbolic notation or cognitive status. Numerical rank irrespective of the sensory properties of objects is encoded by neurons in the lateral prefrontal cortex of monkeys. Neurons that encode the ordinal position of task-related hand or eye movements have been found in a variety of motor-related cortical areas in trained monkeys. Prefrontal in addition to parietal cortices have also been found to be more strongly activated for order information in human functional imaging studies. Together, neural data on numerosity and serial order indicate that numerical quantity and rank order information are likely to share the same neural system, with the prefrontal cortex and the intra-parietal sulcus as key structures.},

An effective GBL strategy should address the learning aspects and promote players' engagement in an easy-to-use system. To gather the information already present in literature, we sought to answer how learning, engagement, and usability of games are evaluated in GBL research. We conducted a systematic review of empirical studies in ERIC, IEEE, Springer, and Web of Science databases. We included 91 studies for the final analysis and categorized their measures and instruments. We find a prevalence of learning assessments over engagement and usability assessments. Learning is mainly evaluated by direct measures, while indirect measures mostly assess engagement and usability. The use of indirect measures and instruments without psychometric qualities compromises the strength of the evidence for the effectiveness of game-based learning. Future studies should add direct assessments and indirect measures with psychometric qualities to assess engagement and usability. The study's limitations are discussed.},

We monitored observers’ eye movements while they freely viewed real-world social scenes containing either 1 or 3 people situated among a variety of objects. Building from the work of Yarbus (1965/1967) we hypothesized that observers would demonstrate a preferential bias to fixate the eyes of the people in the scene, although other items would also receive attention. In addition, we hypothesized that fixations to the eyes would increase as the social content (i.e., number of people) increased. Both hypotheses were supported by the data, and we also found that the level of activity in the scene influenced attention to eyes when social content was high. The present results provide support for the notion that the eyes are selected by others in order to extract social information. Our study also suggests a simple and surreptitious methodology for studying social attention to real-world stimuli in a range of populations, such as those with autism spectrum disorders.},

But little is known about these phenomena in the context of video games, with recent advances finding that they do not necessarily extend to games (Emmerich and Masuch 2018). In Experiment 1 (N=1489; No Observation vs. Researcher Observing), we find that participants observed by a researcher played significantly longer, and performed significantly better, across three video games. Moreover, we find some support that participants observed by a researcher score higher on player experience and intrinsic motivation. In Experiment 2 (N=843; Researcher Observing vs. Professor Observing), we seek to understand whether different roles differing in their perceived evaluativeness would influence the effects of observation. We find that participants observed by a professor had, at times, significantly lower performance, player experience, intrinsic motivation, playing time, and higher anxiety. In Experiment 3 (N=1358; No Observation vs. Researcher Observing), we further validate Experiment 1 by extending our results to three additional game genres. Here, we provide the largest study on observation in video games to date. The study is also the first to show that observer type can significantly influence player outcomes.},

	abstract = {Humans appear to be sensitive to relative small changes in their surroundings. These changes are often initially perceived as irrelevant, but they can cause significant changes in behavior. However, how exactly people’s behavior changes is often hard to quantify. A reliable and valid tool is needed in order to address such a question, ideally measuring an important point of interaction, such as the hand. Wearable-body-sensor systems can be used to obtain valuable, behavioral information. These systems are particularly useful for assessing functional interactions that occur between the endpoints of the upper limbs and our surroundings. A new method is explored that consists of computing hand position using a wearable sensor system and validating it against a gold standard reference measurement (optical tracking device). Initial outcomes related well to the gold standard measurements (r = 0.81) showing an acceptable average root mean square error of 0.09 meters. Subsequently, the use of this approach was further investigated by measuring differences in motor behavior, in response to a changing environment. Three subjects were asked to perform a water pouring task with three slightly different containers. Wavelet analysis was introduced to assess how motor consistency was affected by these small environmental changes. Results showed that the behavioral motor adjustments to a variable environment could be assessed by applying wavelet coherence techniques. Applying these procedures in everyday life, combined with correct research methodologies, can assist in quantifying how environmental changes can cause alterations in our motor behavior.},

The present study used event-related brain potentials to examine how such oculomotor errors are detected, evaluated, and compensated for and whether awareness of an error played a role at any of these stages of processing. The results show that the early processes of error detection and correction (as represented by the error-related negativity and the parietal N1) are not directly affected by subjective awareness of making an error. Instead, they seem to be modulated by the degree of temporal overlap between the programming of the correct and erroneous saccade. We found that only a later component (the error-related positivity [Pe]) is modulated by awareness of making an erroneous eye movement. We propose that awareness of oculomotor capture primarily depends on this later process.},

	abstract = {Introduction: This study is aimed at gaining more insight into the effects of camera-surveillance on behavior. It investigates the effects of three different ways of “framing” camera presence on cheating behavior and pro-social behavior. First, we explore the effect of presenting the camera as the medium through which an intimidating authority watches the participant. Second, we test the effect of presenting the camera as being a neutral, non-intimidating viewer. Third, we investigate the effect of watching oneself via a camera. In contrast to most studies on camera surveillance, we will conduct our experiments in an indoor setting. We also explore possible interaction effects of personality traits; we measured Locus of Control, Need for Approval, Self-Monitoring and Social Value Orientation.Methods: In this experiment participated 86 students, randomly distributed over four conditions: three different ways of framing the camera presence, plus a control condition. Our main dependent variables were various kinds of cheating and pro-social behavior. We established the participant's relevant personality traits using a classification tree.Results: For cheating behavior, findings showed that in the “authorative” way of framing camera presence and in the situation in which participants viewed themselves, participants cheated significantly less compared to a situation without camera-surveillance. We did not find significant effects of camera surveillance on pro-social behavior. Looking at personality traits, we found an indication that people with an internal locus of control are more inclined to cheat when there is no camera present compared to people with an external locus of control. However, the effects of our manipulations were stronger.Conclusion: Our findings support the idea that the framing of a camera's presence does indeed influence cheating behavior, adding to the preventive effects of camera-surveillance. Additionally, this study provides some valuable insights into the influence of camera presence on behavior in general.},

The indirect method measured student perceived knowledge and abilities on course topics, while the direct method measured actual knowledge where students answered test questions or solved problems reflecting course content. Both measures independently demonstrated increases from pretest to posttest; however the indirect measure did not correlate with final course grades. Results also showed respondents scoring lower on the direct measure were overconfident (as measured by indirect score) in their perceived knowledge and ability, the Dunning-Kruger Effect. Based on our findings, we concluded that the indirect method was not an accurate measure of student learning, but may have benefits as an instructional tool.},

A new theory of social impact is examined that views social influence as resulting from forces operating in a social force field. It proposes that influence by either a majority or a minority will be a multiplicative function of the strength, immediacy, and number of its members. It is suggested that social impact theory offers a general model of social influence processes that integrates previous theoretical formulations and empirical findings and accounts for the reciprocal influence of majorities and minorities. Thus, by viewing social influence as a unitary concept, social impact theory permits comparisons between conformity and innovation and predicts the relative magnitude of their effects.

However, incorporating aspects of visual attention in image quality models by means of a perceptually optimized strategy is largely unexplored. Fundamental challenges, such as how visual attention is affected by the concurrence of visual signals and their distortions; whether visual attention affected by distortion or that driven by the original scene only should be included in an image quality model; and how to select visual attention models for the image quality application context, remain. To shed light on the above unsolved issues, designing and performing eye-tracking experiments are essential. Collecting eye-tracking data for the purpose of image quality study is so far confronted with a bias due to the involvement of stimulus repetition. In this paper, we propose a new experimental methodology to eliminate such inherent bias. This allows obtaining reliable eye-tracking data with a large degree of stimulus variability. In fact, we first conducted 5760 eye movement trials that included 160 human observers freely viewing 288 images of varying quality. We then made use of the resulting eye-tracking data to provide insights into the optimal use of visual attention in image quality research. The new eye-tracking data are made publicly available to the research community.},

Because people vary in the extent to which they strive for others' approval, it was expected that the effects of security cameras on prosocial behavior vary with participants' need for approval. To test these predictions, an experimental study was conducted with “presence of security camera” and “need for approval” as independent variables. Results showed that participants indeed offered more help in the presence of a security camera but only to the extent that this helping involved public or observable behavior. As expected, this effect was more pronounced for individuals high in need for approval. Practical implications and suggestions for future research are discussed.},

Using an emotion stop-signal paradigm, we found that viewing emotionally-arousing erotic images before attempting to inhibit a motor response impaired participants’ inhibition ability, but such an impairing effect was completely eliminated when participants were led to believe that their facial expressions were monitored by a webcam. Furthermore, there was no post-error slowing in any of the conditions, thus these results cannot be explained by a deliberate speed-accuracy tradeoff or other types of conscious shift in strategy. Together, these findings demonstrate that the interaction between emotional arousal and impulse control can be dependent on one’s state of self-consciousness. Furthermore, this study also highlights the effect that the mere presence of the experimenter may have on participants’ cognitive performance, even if it’s only a webcam.},

The results indicate that although students perceived team testing to have a substantial impact on their learning, this pedagogy in fact had no impact on direct measures of learning. In an additional analysis, the performance of the team on the group test was best predicted by the best individual performance on the team.

Among modern neurophysiological methods that “measure” different processes of the human brain to salience stimuli, a special place belongs to eye tracking (ET). By detecting eye position, gaze direction, sequence of eye movement and visual adaptation during cognitive activities, ET is an effective tool for experimental psychology and neurological research. It provides a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the gaze, which is very useful in understanding choice behavior and perceptual decision making. In the high tech era, ET has several applications related to the interaction between humans and computers. Herein, ET is used to evaluate the spatial orienting of attention, the performance in visual tasks, the reactions to information on websites, the customer response to advertising, and the emotional and cognitive impact of various spurs to the brain.},

In using design research methods in the area of acquiring functional understanding, data is usually gathered through interviews or observations. Since vision is tightly related to cognition, eye tracking may provide deeper insights into the analyzing behavior of humans. This paper investigates the applicability of different eye tracking technologies for research into function recognition. Pilot studies were conducted to show the practicability of the proposed technologies. In addition to that, the paper introduces relevant analysis methods for raw gaze data. The results suggest that remote and head mounted eye trackers are well suited to observing the behavior of engineers who are analyzing a technical system in different representation forms. Based on these findings, the authors propose the use of eye tracking technologies in qualitative and quantitative empirical studies of how engineers build up understanding of technical systems.},

As in the distributed semantics, we define different scenarios containing only some typicality inclusions, each one having a suitable probability. We then exploit such scenarios in order to ascribe typical properties to a concept C obtained as the combination of two prototypical concepts.

However, little research has been conducted that explores teacher innovative behavior and which factors influence this behavior or what effects can be achieved through such behavior. In this systematic literature review, we develop a preliminary model of factors that enhance innovative behavior in educational organizations. Similar to findings of studies in other human behavior fields, self-efficacy plays an important role as well as a variety of individual and environmental factors.

We show how such mechanism can be obtained trough a framework of dynamic knowledge generation that is able to tackle the problem of commonsense concept combination. In addition, we show how such a framework can be employed in the field of cognitive architectures in order to overcome situations like the impasse in SOAR by extending the possible options of its subgoaling procedures.},

A major issue in semantic network research is that there is no consensus among researchers as to the best method for estimating the network of an individual or group. We propose a novel method (U-INVITE) for estimating semantic networks from semantic fluency data (listing items from a category) based on a censored random walk model of memory retrieval. We compare this method to several other methods in the literature for estimating networks from semantic fluency data. In simulations, we find that U-INVITE can recover semantic networks with low error rates given only a moderate amount of data. U-INVITE is the only known method derived from a psychologically plausible process model of memory retrieval and one of two known methods that we found to be consistent estimators of this process: if semantic memory retrieval is consistent with this process, the procedure will eventually estimate the true network (given enough data). We conduct the first exploration of different methods for estimating psychologically valid semantic networks by comparing people’s similarity judgments of edges estimated by each network estimation method. To encourage best practices, we discuss the merits of each network estimation technique, provide a flow chart that assists with choosing an appropriate method, and supply code for others to employ these techniques on their own data.},

In understanding external selection, a classic distinction is made between voluntary (goal-directed) and involuntary (stimulus-driven) guidance of attention. We have developed a task—the anti-retrocue task—to separate and examine voluntary and involuntary guidance of attention to internal representations in visual working memory. We show that both voluntary and involuntary factors influence memory performance but do so in distinct ways. Moreover, by tracking gaze biases linked to attentional focusing in memory, we provide direct evidence for an involuntary “retro-capture” effect whereby external stimuli involuntarily trigger the selection of feature-matching internal representations. We show that stimulus-driven and goal-directed influences compete for selection in memory, and that the balance of this competition—as reflected in oculomotor signatures of internal attention—predicts the quality of ensuing memory-guided behavior. Thus, goal-directed and stimulus-driven factors together determine the fate not only of perception, but also of internal representations in working memory.},

Here we leverage computational network science tools to study hidden knowledge structures of 67 Swiss schoolchildren from two distinct educational backgrounds—Montessori and traditional, matched on socioeconomic factors and nonverbal intelligence—to examine how educational experience shape semantic memory and creative thinking. We find that children experiencing Montessori education show a more flexible semantic network structure (high connectivity/short paths between concepts, less modularity) alongside higher scores on creative thinking tests. The findings indicate that education impacts how children represent concepts in semantic memory and suggest that different educational experiences can affect higher cognitive functions, including creative thinking.},

These metacognitions could also be diagnostic for distinguishing among different classes of problems, each perhaps controlled by different cognitive processes. In the present experiments, intuitions on classic insight problems were compared with those on noninsight and algebra problems. The findings were as follows: (1) subjective feeling of knowing predicted performance on algebra problems but not on insight problems; (2) subjects’ expectations of performance greatly exceeded their actual performance, especially on insight problems; (3) normative predictions provided a better estimate of individual performance than did subjects’ own predictions, especially on the insight problems; and, most importantly, (4) the patterns-of-warmth ratings, which reflect subjects’ feelings of approaching solution, differed for insight and noninsight problems. Algebra problems and noninsight problems showed a more incremental pattern over the course of solving than did insight problems. In general, then, the data indicated that noninsight problems were open to accurate predictions of performance, whereas insight problems were opaque to such predictions. Also, the phenomenology of insight-problem solution was characterized by a sudden, unforeseen flash of illumination. We propose that the difference in phenomenology accompanying insight and noninsight problem solving, as empirically demonstrated here, be used to define insight.},

The relationships of these two types of problem-solving tasks with meta-cognitive awareness were also assessed. Participants performed a set of planning tasks, a set of insight tasks and a self-report inventory on metacognitive ability. The CFA results revealed that planning and insight problem solving were closely related constructs and were not clearly separable. Model comparisons indicated that the fit of the alternative one-factor model was slightly better than the fit of the two-factor model. The correlational results showed that both planning task performance and insight problem-solving performance had no correlations with the metacognitive knowledge or the metacognitive regulation components of the metacognitive awareness inventory.},

Recent advances in quantitative methods based on network science have investigated the effect of aging on semantic memory structure. However, it is yet to be determined how this aging effect on semantic memory structure relates to its overall flexibility. Percolation analysis provides a quantitative measure of the flexibility of a semantic network, by examining how a semantic memory network is resistant to “attacks” or breaking apart. In this study, we incorporated percolation analyses to examine how semantic networks of younger and older adults break apart to investigate potential age-related differences in language production. We applied the percolation analysis to 3 independent sets of data (total N = 78 younger, 78 older adults) from which we generated semantic networks based on verbal fluency performance. Across all 3 datasets, the percolation integrals of the younger adults were larger than older adults, indicating that older adults' semantic networks were less flexible and broke down faster than the younger adults'. Our findings provide quantitative evidence for diminished flexibility in older adults' semantic networks, despite the stability of semantic knowledge across the lifespan. This may be one contributing factor to age-related differences in language production.},

	volume = {37},
	doi = {10.1108/PM-10-2018-0056},
	abstract = {Purpose
Behavioural studies of valuers have suggested that valuers rely on a number of cognitive strategies involving reasoning and intuition when undertaking a valuation task. However, there are few studies of the actual reasoning mechanisms in valuation. In other fields, much attention has been paid to forward and backward reasoning, as this shows the choices and decisions that are made in undertaking a complex task. This paper studied this during a valuation task. The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to develop a methodological approach for empirical research on valuers’ reasoning, and, second, to report expert-novice differences on valuers’ use of forward and backward reasoning during a valuation problem solving.

Design/methodology/approach
The study utilised a verbal protocol analysis (VPA) to elicit think-aloud data from a purposive sample of a group of valuers of different levels of expertise undertaking a commercial-valuation task. Through a content analysis interpretive strategy, the transcripts were analysed into different cognitive segments identifying the forward and backward reasoning strategies.

Findings
The findings showed that valuers accomplished the valuation task by dividing the overall problem into sub-problems. These sub-problems are thereafter solved by integrating available data with existing knowledge by relying more on forward reasoning than backward reasoning. However, there were effects associated with the level of expertise in the way the processes of forward and backward reasoning are used, with the expert and intermediate valuers being more thorough and comprehensive in their reasoning process than the novices.

Research limitations/implications
This study explores the possibility that forward and backward reasoning play an important role in commercial valuation problem solving using a limited sample of valuers. Given this, data cannot be generalised to all valuation practice settings but may motivate future research that examines the effectiveness of forward and backward reasoning in diverse valuation practice settings and develops a holistic model of valuation reasoning.

Practical implications
The findings of this study are applicable to valuation practice. Future training efforts need to evaluate the usefulness of teaching problem solving and explicitly recognise forward and backward reasoning, along with other problem-solving strategies uncovered in this study, as standard training strategies for influencing the quality of valuation decisions.

Originality/value
By adopting VPA, this study employs an insightful and rich dataset which allows an interpretation of thoughts of valuers into cognitive reasoning strategies that provide a deeper level of understanding of how valuers solve valuation problem; this has not been possible in previous related valuation studies.},

	abstract = {The Pedagogy of Creativity represents a groundbreaking study linking the pedagogy of classroom creativity with psychoanalytical theories. Taking a classroom-based example of poststructuralist methodology as its starting point, Anna Herbert’s investigation explores the relationship between creativity seen in psychological activity, such as dreams, and creativity seen in the classroom, asking the following questions:


What might a methodology which taps into different forms of creativity look like? 


Could such a methodology support current neuropsychological theories of memory and learning? 


What are the consequences of imaginary and symbolic orders of knowledge for the understanding of both conscious and unconscious creativity in the classroom?

Exploring the ideas of a number of psychological analysts including Jacques Lacan’s four discourses, concepts of ‘the other’ and the theories of Postructuralist thinkers including Levinas, Mead and Kristeva, Herbert explains how different theories can be used to develop creativity in the classroom and surmount obstacles preventing creative environments.
Clearly presenting both theoretical positions and their bearing on classroom practice, teachers at all levels will benefit from this innovative approach to creativity, as will school psychologists and all professionals interested in the links between psychoanalysis and pedagogy.

This model is tested in a number of studies in which participants performed creative ideation tasks. We review work showing that cognitive flexibility, operationalised as the number of content categories surveyed, directly relates to idea originality, but that originality can also be achieved by exploring a few content categories in great depth (i.e., persistence). We also show that a global processing mode is associated with cognitive flexibility, but only leads to high originality in tasks that capitalise on cognitive flexibility. We finally show that activating positive mood states enhance creativity because they stimulate flexibility, while activating negative mood states can enhance creativity because they stimulate persistence.

The core idea is to predict latent representations of the full input data based on a masked view of the input in a self-distillation setup using a standard Transformer architecture. Instead of predicting modality-specific targets such as words, visual tokens or units of human speech which are local in nature, data2vec predicts contextualized latent representations that contain information from the entire input.

The formal similarities between 3-valued approaches to vagueness and formalisms that handle incomplete information often lead to a confusion between degrees of truth and degrees of uncertainty. Yet there are important differences that appear at the interpretive level: while truth-functional logics of vagueness are accepted by a part of the scientific community (even if questioned by supervaluationists), the truth-functionality assumption of three-valued calculi for handling incomplete information looks questionable, compared to the non-truth-functional approaches based on Boolean possibility–necessity pairs. This paper aims to clarify the similarities and differences between the two situations. We also study to what extent operations for comparing and merging information items in the form of orthopairs can be expressed by means of operations on valuation pairs, three-valued valuations and underlying possibility distributions.},

Taking into account the realistic fact that the spike time is only known within some finite precision, we propose a model where spikes are effective at times multiple of a characteristic time scale, which can be arbitrary small (in particular, well beyond the numerical precision). We make a complete mathematical characterization of the model-dynamics and obtain the following results. The asymptotic dynamics is composed by finitely many stable periodic orbits, whose number and period can be arbitrary large and can diverge in a region of the synaptic weights space, traditionally called the ``edge of chaos'', a notion mathematically well defined in the present paper. Furthermore, except at the edge of chaos, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the membrane potential trajectories and the raster plot. This shows that the neural code is entirely ``in the spikes'' in this case. As a key tool, we introduce an order parameter, easy to compute numerically, and closely related to a natural notion of entropy, providing a relevant characterization of the computational capabilities of the network. This allows us to compare the computational capabilities of leaky and Integrate-and-Fire models and conductance based models.

	abstract = {Soar is a problem solving system that is based on formulating all activity (both problems and routine tasks) as heuristic search in problem spaces. A problem space consists of a set of states and a set of operators that transform one state into another. Starting from an initial state the problem solver applies a sequence of operators in an attempt to reach a desired state. Soar uses a production system1 to implement elementary operators, tests for goal satisfaction and failure, and search control — information relevant to the selection of goals, problem spaces, states, and operators. It is possible to use a problem space that has no search control, only operators and goal recognizers. Such a space will work correctly, but will be slow because of the amount of search required.},

Economists have long argued on theoretical grounds that humans typically make these choices as if the values of the options they consider have been mapped to a single common scale for comparison. Neuroimaging studies in humans have recently begun to suggest the existence of a small group of specific brain sites that appear to encode the subjective values of different types of rewards on a neural common scale, almost exactly as predicted by theory. We have conducted a meta analysis using data from thirteen different functional magnetic resonance imaging studies published in recent years and we show that the principle brain area associated with this common representation is a subregion of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC)/orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The data available today suggest that this common valuation path is a core system that participates in day-to-day decision making suggesting both a neurobiological foundation for standard economic theory and a tool for measuring preferences neurobiologically. Perhaps even more exciting is the possibility that our emerging understanding of the neural mechanisms for valuation and choice may provide fundamental insights into pathological choice behaviors like addiction, obesity and gambling.},

Hierarchical reinforcement learning is a promising computational approach that may eventually yield comparable problem-solving behaviour in artificial agents and robots. However, so far, the problem-solving abilities of many human and non-human animals are clearly superior to those of artificial systems. Here we propose steps to integrate biologically inspired hierarchical mechanisms to enable advanced problem-solving skills in artificial agents. We first review the literature in cognitive psychology to highlight the importance of compositional abstraction and predictive processing. Then we relate the gained insights with contemporary hierarchical reinforcement learning methods. Interestingly, our results suggest that all identified cognitive mechanisms have been implemented individually in isolated computational architectures, raising the question of why there exists no single unifying architecture that integrates them. As our final contribution, we address this question by providing an integrative perspective on the computational challenges to develop such a unifying architecture. We expect our results to guide the development of more sophisticated cognitively inspired hierarchical machine learning architectures.},

	abstract = {Deciding about courses of action involves minimizing costs and maximizing benefits. Decision neuroscience studies have suggested a dissociation between the ventral and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC and dmPFC), which would provide estimates of goal value and action cost, respectively. However, this general idea of opponent reward and effort systems has been challenged by several studies that suggested alternative functional dissociations. These contradictions might reflect the diversity of tasks used to investigate the reward/effort tradeoff, and/or the confusion with a metacognitive tradeoff that minimizes the duration of deliberation while maximizing confidence in the behavioral response. Here, we used an original approach with the goal of identifying consistencies across several preference tasks, from likeability ratings to binary decisions involving both attribute integration and option comparison. FMRI results confirmed the vmPFC as a generic valuation system, its activity increasing with reward value and decreasing with effort cost. In contrast, more dorsal regions were not concerned with attributes of options but with metacognitive estimates, confidence level being computed in the mPFC and deliberation time in the dmPFC. Thus, assessing commonalities across preference tasks might help reaching a unified view of the neural mechanisms underlying the cost/benefit tradeoffs that drive human behavior.},

This study proposes a pedagogical model named the Spiral Model of Collaborative Knowledge Improvement (SMCKI) to inform the design and implementation of multi-layered collaborative learning activities in a networked class where there are many groups of students working collaboratively. Starting with a phase of individual ideation, the pedagogical model scaffolds students to go through five phases of intra-group and inter-group knowledge improvement and refinement, with the goal of supporting the advancement of their individual and collective knowledge. An exploratory case study is presented to illustrate how this model was used in a pre-service teachers’ technology-enhanced learning (TEL) activity design lesson in a Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) environment. The results show that the participants significantly improved the quality of TEL design throughout the five phases of SMCKI. The implications of the findings on designing and implementing CSCL activities in authentic class environments are discussed.},

Emerging evidence suggests that abstracted representations in medial prefrontal cortex guide reactivation of related memories during new encoding events, thus promoting hippocampal integration of related experiences. Moreover, recent work indicates that integrated memories are called upon during novel situations to facilitate a host of behaviors, from spatial navigation to imagination.},

The models we created, using the cognitive architecture Soar, vary by using two distinct methods of retrieval from semantic memory. The knowledge bases used in our models vary in that one uses only collocations and compound words to form word associations while the other is from a crowd-sourced dataset with unrestricted types of word association. The model which best matches human difficulty relies on spreading activation to drive retrieval and uses the crowd-sourced dataset for its knowledge base.},

However, educators tend not to understand creativity appropriately or to value it strongly—and they tend to see it only through Western eyes. Only by considering other cultural views will we gain insights that can inform educational practice in the 21st-century global community. This article discusses some recent studies of creativity, reflecting the growing global interest in it and comparing that interest with established Western perspectives.

In this paper eight frameworks describing 21st century competences were analysed. A comprehensive search for information about 21st century competences was conducted across the official websites of the selected frameworks, resulting in 32 documents that were analysed in detail. Travers and Westbury’s framework of curriculum representations was used to determine horizontal and vertical consistency between the frameworks. The frameworks were compared on their underlying rationales and goals, their definition of 21st century competences, and the recommended strategies for the implementation and assessment of these skills in educational practice. In addition three international studies were examined to analyse how various countries (EU member states, OECD countries) and schools (SITES studies) deal (or not) with 21st century competences. The findings indicate a large extent of alignment between the frameworks about what 21st century competences are and why they are important (horizontal consistency), but intentions and practice seemed still far apart, indicating lack of vertical consistency. The implications of the implementation of 21st century competences in national curriculum policies are discussed and recommendations are provided.},

	abstract = {Creativity is a complex construct that would benefit from a more comprehensive mechanistic approach. Two processes have been defined to be central to creative cognition: divergent and convergent thinking. These two processes are most often studied using the Alternate Uses Test (heavily relying on divergent thinking), and the Remote Associates Test (heavily relying on convergent thinking, at least with analytical solutions). Although creative acts should be regarded compound processes, most behavioral and neuroimaging studies ignore the composition of basic operations relevant for the task they investigate. In order to provide leverage for a more mechanistic, and eventually even comprehensive computational, approach to creative cognition, we compare findings from divergent and convergent thinking studies and review the similarities and differences between the two underlying types of processes, from a neurocognitive perspective with a strong focus on cortical structures. In this narrative review, we discuss a broad scope of neural correlates of divergent and convergent thinking. We provide a first step towards theoretical integration, by suggesting that creative cognition in divergent- and convergent-thinking heavy tasks is modulated by metacontrol states, where divergent thinking and insight solutions in convergent-thinking tasks seem to benefit from metacontrol biases towards flexibility, whereas convergent, analytical thinking seems to benefit from metacontrol biases towards persistence. These particular biases seem to be reflected by specific cortical brain-activation patterns, involving left frontal and right temporal/parietal networks. Our tentative framework could serve as a first proxy to guide neuroscientific creativity research into assessing more mechanistic details of human creative cognition.},

	abstract = {Early accounts of problem solving focused on the ways people represent information directly related to target problems and possible solutions. Subsequent theory and research point to the role of peripheral influences such as heuristics and bodily states. We discuss how metaphor and analogy similarly influence stages of everyday problem solving: Both processes mentally map features of a target problem onto the structure of a relatively more familiar concept. When individuals apply this structure, they use a well-known concept as a framework for reasoning about real world problems and candidate solutions. Early studies found that analogy use helped people gain insight into novel problems. More recent research on metaphor goes further to show that activating mappings has subtle, sometimes surprising effects on judgment and reasoning in everyday problem solving. These findings highlight situations in which mappings can help or hinder efforts to solve problems.

Natural embodied and situated agents often solve spatial tasks without detailed knowledge about geometric, topological, or mechanical laws; they directly relate actions to effects enabled by spatio-temporal affordances in their bodies and their environments. Accordingly, we propose a cognitive processing paradigm that makes the spatio-temporal substrate an integral part of the problem-solving engine. We show how spatial and temporal structures in body and environment can support and replace reasoning effort in computational processes: physical manipulation and perception in spatial environments substitute formal computation, in this approach. The strong spatial cognition paradigm employs affordance-based object-level problem solving to complement knowledge-level computation. The paper presents proofs of concept by providing physical spatial solutions to familiar spatial problems for which no equivalent computational solutions are known.},

In the grand scheme of history of artificial intelligence (AI), this is surely a minor event. The field this scientific society represents has been thriving for quite some time. No doubt the society itself will make solid contributions to the health of our field. But it is too much to expect a presidential address to have a major impact. So what is the role of the presidential address and what is the significance of the first one? I believe its role is to set a tone, to provide an emphasis. I think the role of the first address is to take a stand about what that tone and emphasis should be-set expectations for future addresses and to communicate to my fellow presidents. Only two foci are really possible for a presidential address: the state of the society or the state of the science. I believe the latter to be correct focus. AAAI itself, its nature and its relationship to the larger society that surrounds it, are surely important. However, our main business is to help AI become a science -- albeit a science with a strong engineering flavor. Thus, though a president's address cannot be narrow or highly technical, it can certainly address a substantive issue. That is what I propose to do.},

However, Metcalfe (1986) indicated that participants would often present an inelegant but plausible (wrong) answer as correct with a high feeling of warmth (a subjective measure of closeness to solution). This discrepancy may be due to the use of different tasks or due to different methods in the measurement of insight (i.e., using a binary vs. continuous scale). In three experiments, we investigated both findings, using many different problem tasks (e.g., Compound Remote Associates, so-called classic insight problems, and non-insight problems). Participants rated insight-related affect (feelings of Aha-experience, confidence, surprise, impasse, and pleasure) on continuous scales. As expected we found that, for problems designed to elicit insight, correct solutions elicited higher proportions of reported insight in the solution compared to non-insight solutions; further, correct solutions elicited stronger feelings of insight compared to incorrect solutions.},

This article describes the use of continuous vector space models for reasoning with a formal knowledge base. The practical significance of these models is that they support fast, approximate but robust inference and hypothesis generation, which is complementary to the slow, exact, but sometimes brittle behaviour of more traditional deduction engines such as theorem provers.

The article explains the way logical connectives can be used in semantic vector models, and summarizes the development of Predication-based Semantic Indexing, which involves the use of Vector Symbolic Architectures to represent the concepts and relationships from a knowledge base of subject-predicate-object triples. Experiments show that the use of continuous models for formal reasoning is not only possible, but already demonstrably effective for some recognized informatics tasks, and showing promise in other traditional problem areas. Examples described in this article include: predicting new uses for existing drugs in biomedical informatics; removing unwanted meanings from search results in information retrieval and concept navigation; type inference from attributes; comparing words based on their orthography; and representing tabular data, including modelling numerical values.

Recorded over time, each learner draws a trajectory in that hyperspace, which we build and analyze with spatio-temporal data structures and algorithms that are known from the ﬁeld of spatio-temporal databases. Finally, we explain how our ontologies and the CST can be used to create adaptive systems. We do this on a universal basis that is derived from the concept of the Turing machine. Therefore, our idea provides a technology-independent design strategy that can be implemented in any form of automaton. Both the ontology approach and the CST have been implemented in prototype systems that are presented in this document.},

	abstract = {A new theoretical model for the design of creativity-enhancing interfaces is proposed, which predicts that the majority of computer interfaces provide separate parameters, altered sequentially and predicts that these oneto-one mappings encourage a particular navigation strategy (“Explicit-Convergent”) and as such may inhibit certain aspects of creativity. This paper proposes a new theoretical model for the design of creativity-enhancing interfaces. The combination of user and content creation software is looked at as a creative system, and we tackle the question of how best to design the interface to utilise the abilities of both the computer and the brain. This model has been developed in the context of music technology, but may apply to any situation in which a large number of feature parameters must be adjusted to achieve a creative result. The model of creativity inspiring this approach is Wiggins’ Creative Systems Framework. Two further theories from cognitive psychology motivate the model: the notion of creativity being composed of divergent and convergent thought processes, and the “dual process” theory of implicit vs. explicit thought. These two axes are combined to describe four different solution space traversal strategies. The majority of computer interfaces provide separate parameters, altered sequentially. This theory predicts that these oneto-one mappings encourage a particular navigation strategy (“Explicit-Convergent”) and as such may inhibit certain aspects of creativity.},

But for all its prominence at the apex of human mental faculties, we know next to nothing about how brains generate creative ideas. With all previous attempts to tighten the screws on this vexed problem unsuccessful – right brains, divergent thinking, defocused attention, default mode network, alpha enhancement, prefrontal activation, etc. (Dietrich and Kanso, 2010) – the neuroscientific study of creativity finds itself in a theoretical arid zone that has perhaps no equal in psychology. We propose here a general framework for a fresh attack on the problem and set it out under 10 foundational concepts. Most of the ideas we favor are part and parcel of the standard conceptual toolbox of cognitive neuroscience but their combination and significance to creativity are original. By outlining, even in such broad strokes, the theoretical landscape of cognitive neuroscience as it relates to creative insights, we hope to bring into clear focus the key enabling factors that are likely to have a hand in computing ideational combinations in the brain.},

This phase is oriented to approximate some painting styles obtained from famous images and portraits of the past. The learned filter sequences are then used during the Production Phase. During this subsequent phase, the “artificial artist” interacts with the subject trying to “catch” the human emotions that drive the creation of the portrait. The artist processes feedbacks from the user according to the cognitive model Psi and its implementation of the motivations. These motivations influence further modifications of the applied filter sequences achieving an evolution of the artificial artist.},

	abstract = {The paper proposes a novel cognitive architecture (CA) for computational creativity based on the Psi model and on the mechanisms inspired by dual process theories of reasoning and rationality. In recent years, many cognitive models have focused on dual process theories to better describe and implement complex cognitive skills in artificial agents, but creativity has been approached only at a descriptive level. In previous works we have described various modules of the cognitive architecture that allows a robot to execute creative paintings. By means of dual process theories we refine some relevant mechanisms to obtain artworks, and in particular we explain details about resolution level of the CA dealing with different strategies of access to the Long Term Memory (LTM) and managing the interaction between S1 and S2 processes of the dual process theory. The creative process involves both divergent and convergent processes in either implicit or explicit manner. This leads to four activities (exploratory, reflective, tacit, and analytic) that, triggered by urges and motivations, generate creative acts. These creative acts exploit both the LTM and the WM in order to make novel substitutions to a perceived image by properly mixing parts of pictures coming from different domains. The paper highlights the role of the interaction between S1 and S2 processes, modulated by the resolution level which focuses the attention of the creative agent by broadening or narrowing the exploration of novel solutions, or even drawing the solution from a set of already made associations. An example of artificial painter is described in some experimentations by using a robotic platform.},

	abstract = {Creativity is a vast construct, seemingly intractable to scientific inquiry—perhaps due to the vague concepts applied to the field of research. One attempt to limit the purview of creative cognition formulates the construct in terms of evolutionary constraints, namely that of blind variation and selective retention (BVSR). Behaviorally, one can limit the “blind variation” component to idea generation tests as manifested by measures of divergent thinking. The “selective retention” component can be represented by measures of convergent thinking, as represented by measures of remote associates. We summarize results from measures of creative cognition, correlated with structural neuroimaging measures including structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). We also review lesion studies, considered to be the “gold standard” of brain-behavioral studies. What emerges is a picture consistent with theories of disinhibitory brain features subserving creative cognition, as described previously (Martindale, 1981). We provide a perspective, involving aspects of the default mode network (DMN), which might provide a “first approximation” regarding how creative cognition might map on to the human brain.},

This chapter strives to reduce that confusion and makes up-to-date assessments of these types of memory. Long- and short-term memory could differ in two fundamental ways, with only short-term memory demonstrating (1) temporal decay and (2) chunk capacity limits. Both properties of short-term memory are still controversial but the current literature is rather encouraging regarding the existence of both decay and capacity limits. Working memory has been conceived and defined in three different, slightly discrepant ways: as short-term memory applied to cognitive tasks, as a multi-component system that holds and manipulates information in short-term memory, and as the use of attention to manage short-term memory. Regardless of the definition, there are some measures of memory in the short term that seem routine and do not correlate well with cognitive aptitudes and other measures (those usually identified with the term “working memory”) that seem more attention demanding and do correlate well with these aptitudes. The evidence is evaluated and placed within a theoretical framework depicted in .},

At time scales of approximately 1⁄3 of a second, orienting movements of the body play a crucial role in cognition and form a useful computational level – more abstract than that used to capture natural phenomena but less abstract than what is traditionally used to study high-level cognitive processes such as reasoning. At this “embodiment level,” the constraints of the physical system determine the nature of cognitive operations. The key synergy is that at time scales of about 1⁄3 of a second, the natural sequentiality of body movements can be matched to the natural computational economies of sequential decision systems through a system of implicit reference called deictic in which pointing movements are used to bind objects in the world to cognitive programs. This target article focuses on how deictic bindings make it possible to perform natural tasks. Deictic computation provides a mechanism for representing the essential features that link external sensory data with internal cognitive programs and motor actions. One of the central features of cognition, working memory, can be related to moment-by-moment dispositions of body features such as eye movements and hand movements.},

The approach distinguishes between short-lived goal-directed actions and durable, object-oriented activity systems. A historically evolving collective activity system, seen in its network relations to other activity systems, is taken as the prime unit of analysis against which scripted strings of goal-directed actions and automatic operations are interpreted. Activity systems are driven by communal motives that are often difficult to articulate for individual participants. Activity systems are in constant movement and internally contradictory. Their systemic contradictions, manifested in disturbances and mundane innovations, offer possibilities for expansive developmental transformations. Such transformations proceed through stepwise cycles of expansive learning which begin with actions of questioning the existing standard practice, then proceed to actions of analyzing its contradictions and modelling a vision for its zone of proximal development, then to actions of examining and implementing the new model in practice. New forms of work organization increasingly require negotiated ‘knotworking’ across boundaries. Correspondingly, expansive learning increasingly involves horizontal widening of collective expertise by means of debating, negotiating and hybridizing different perspectives and conceptualizations. Findings from a longitudinal intervention study of children's medical care illuminate the theoretical arguments.},

First, it leverages recent models of intrinsically motivated learning by transposing them to active teaching, relying on empirical estimation of learning progress provided by specific activities to particular students. Second, it uses state-of-the-art Multi-Arm Bandit (MAB) techniques to efficiently manage the exploration/exploitation challenge of this optimization process. Third, it leverages expert knowledge to constrain and bootstrap initial exploration of the MAB, while requiring only coarse guidance information of the expert and allowing the system to deal with didactic gaps in its knowledge. The system is evaluated in a scenario where 7-8 year old schoolchildren learn how to decompose numbers while manipulating money.

	abstract = {This chapter studies the bidirectional causal interactions between curiosity and learning and discusses how understanding these interactions can be leveraged in educational technology applications. First, we review recent results showing how state curiosity, and more generally the experience of novelty and surprise, can enhance learning and memory retention. Then, we discuss how psychology and neuroscience have conceptualized curiosity and intrinsic motivation, studying how the brain can be intrinsically rewarded by novelty, complexity, or other measures of information. We explain how the framework of computational reinforcement learning can be used to model such mechanisms of curiosity. Then, we discuss the learning progress (LP) hypothesis, which posits a positive feedback loop between curiosity and learning. We outline experiments with robots that show how LP-driven attention and exploration can self-organize a developmental learning curriculum scaffolding efficient acquisition of multiple skills/tasks. Finally, we discuss recent work exploiting these conceptual and computational models in educational technologies, showing in particular how intelligent tutoring systems can be designed to foster curiosity and learning.},

	abstract = {Intuition and insight are intriguing phenomena of non-analytical mental functioning: whereas intuition denotes ideas that have been reached by sensing the solution without any explicit representation of it, insight has been understood as the sudden and unexpected apprehension of the solution by recombining the single elements of a problem. By face validity, the two processes appear similar; according to a lay perspective, it is assumed that intuition precedes insight. Yet, predominant scientific conceptualizations of intuition and insight consider the two processes to differ with regard to their (dis-)continuous unfolding. That is, intuition has been understood as an experience-based and gradual process, whereas insight is regarded as a genuinely discontinuous phenomenon. Unfortunately, both processes have been investigated differently and without much reference to each other. In this contribution, we therefore set out to fill this lacuna by examining the conceptualizations of the assumed underlying cognitive processes of both phenomena, and by also referring to the research traditions and paradigms of the respective field. Based on early work put forward by Bowers et al. (1990, 1995), we referred to semantic coherence tasks consisting of convergent word triads (i.e., the solution has the same meaning to all three clue words) and/or divergent word triads (i.e., the solution means something different with respect to each clue word) as an excellent kind of paradigm that may be used in the future to disentangle intuition and insight experimentally. By scrutinizing the underlying mechanisms of intuition and insight, with this theoretical contribution, we hope to launch lacking but needed experimental studies and to initiate scientific cooperation between the research fields of intuition and insight that are currently still separated from each other.},

	isbn = {978-0-19-514900-5},
	abstract = {What is creativity, and where does it come from? Creativity and Development explores the fascinating connections and tensions between creativity research and developmental psychology, two fields that have largely progressed independently of each other-until now. In this book, scholars influential in both fields explore the emergence of new ideas, and the development of the people and situations that bring them to fruition. The uniquely collaborative nature of Oxford's Counterpoints series allows them to engage in a dialogue, addressing the key issues and potential benefits of exploring the connections between creativity and development. Creativity and Development is based on the observation that both creativity and development are processes that occur in complex systems, in which later stages or changes emerge from the prior state of the system. In the 1970s and 1980s, creativity researchers shifted their focus from personality traits to cognitive and social processes, and the co-authors of this volume are some of the most influential figures in this shift. The central focus on system processes results in three related volume themes: how the outcomes of creativity and development emerge from dynamical processes, the interrelation between individual processes and social processes, and the role of mediating artifacts and domains in developmental and creative processes. The chapters touch on a wide range of important topics, with the authors drawing on their decades of research into creativity and development. Readers will learn about the creativity of children's play, the creative aspects of children's thinking, the creative processes of scientists, the role of education and teaching in creative development, and the role of multiple intelligences in both creativity and development. The final chapter is an important dialogue between the authors, who engage in a roundtable discussion and explore key questions facing contemporary researchers, such as: Does society suppress children's creativity? Are creativity and development specific to an intelligence or a domain? What role do social and cultural contexts play in creativity and development? Creativity and Development presents a powerful argument that both creativity scholars and developmental psychologists will benefit by becoming more familiar with each other's work.},

We introduce the concept of partial probability for propositions, substituting classical logic with Kleene's logic.

Each cost function of the proposed algorithms is the weighted sum of squared errors, that is, the sum of squared errors with different penalties. When we discuss the possibility of Group 1, the penalty for the squared errors relating to the patterns in Group 1 is greater than that of Group 2. This means that, in the possibility analysis of Group 1, we attach greater importance to the patterns in Group 1 than to those in Group 2.

The core of the semi-structured interviews focused on participants' own work-related experiences that could be recalled and discussed in depth. This research validated and augmented prior research while consolidating previous models of serendipity into a single model of the process of serendipity, consisting of: Trigger, Connection, Follow-up, and Valuable Outcome, and an Unexpected Thread that runs through 1 or more of the first 4 elements. Together, the elements influence the Perception of Serendipity. Furthermore, this research identified what factors relating to the individual and their environment may facilitate the main elements of serendipity and further influence its perception.},

	abstract = {This review proposes that two networks of brain areas are involved in controlling attention. One network is primarily responsible for applying cognitive, top-down selection for stimuli and responses, whereas the other detects behaviourally relevant stimuli and might act as a 'circuit breaker' for the first system. Humans use cognitive information to direct attention to relevant objects (targets) in a visual scene. Information such as the target's colour or location is represented as a 'perceptual set'. Similarly, advance information about the required response to a target is represented as a 'motor set'. These can be considered together as an 'attentional set', which aids the detection of and response to targets. Such top-down control of attentional processes activates dorsal posterior parietal and frontal regions of the brain bilaterally in both monkeys and humans. This dorsal frontoparietal system is responsible for the generation of attentional sets. Attention can also be driven by stimulus properties rather than cognitive processes. This 'bottom-up' control of attention explains why we find ourselves drawn to 'oddball' stimuli that are very different from the background, or to salient stimuli that share some sensory features, such as colour, with the target for which we are searching. The dorsal frontoparietal system seems to maintain a 'salience map' that combines bottom-up with top-down information during visual search. Potentially important sensory stimuli, such as loud alarms or sudden movement, can attract our attention regardless of the ongoing task. This sensory orienting process seems to be mediated by the second attentional network, which is mainly lateralized to the right side of the brain and includes the temporoparietal junction and the ventral frontal cortex. This network seems to interrupt ongoing cognitive activity when a stimulus that might be behaviourally important is detected. These two networks could interact in humans to control attention. It is possible that damage to these networks is responsible for the syndrome of neglect, in which patients that have suffered damage to the right side of the brain tend to ignore stimuli on the left side of space. The authors suggest that neglect results from damage to the ventral network that also 'functionally inactivates' the dorsal network.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.neunet.2003.06.005},
	abstract = {This article is about how the brain data mines its sensory inputs. There are several architectural principles of functional brain anatomy that have emerged from careful anatomic and physiologic studies over the past century. These principles are considered in the light of representational learning to see if they could have been predicted a priori on the basis of purely theoretical considerations. We first review the organisation of hierarchical sensory cortices, paying special attention to the distinction between forward and backward connections. We then review various approaches to representational learning as special cases of generative models, starting with supervised learning and ending with learning based upon empirical Bayes. The latter predicts many features, such as a hierarchical cortical system, prevalent top-down backward influences and functional asymmetries between forward and backward connections that are seen in the real brain. The key points made in article are: (i). hierarchical generative models enable the learning of empirical priors and eschew prior assumptions about the causes of sensory input that are inherent in non-hierarchical models. These assumptions are necessary for learning schemes based on information theory and efficient or sparse coding, but are not necessary in a hierarchical context. Critically, the anatomical infrastructure that may implement generative models in the brain is hierarchical. Furthermore, learning based on empirical Bayes can proceed in a biologically plausible way. (ii). The second point is that backward connections are essential if the processes generating inputs cannot be inverted, or the inversion cannot be parameterised. Because these processes involve many-to-one mappings, are non-linear and dynamic in nature, they are generally non-invertible. This enforces an explicit parameterisation of generative models (i.e. backward connections) to afford recognition and suggests that forward architectures, on their own, are not sufficient for perception. (iii). Finally, non-linearities in generative models, mediated by backward connections, require these connections to be modulatory, so that representations in higher cortical levels can interact to predict responses in lower levels. This is important in relation to functional asymmetries in forward and backward connections that have been demonstrated empirically.},

It remains an open question how the brain represents and processes associations. The Remote Associates Test (RAT) is a task, originally used in creativity research, that is heavily dependent on generating associations in a search for the solutions to individual RAT problems. In this work we present a model that solves the test. Compared to earlier modeling work on the RAT, our hybrid (i.e., non-developmental) model is implemented in a spiking neural network by means of the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF), demonstrating that it is possible for spiking neurons to be organized to store the employed representations and to manipulate them. In particular, the model shows that distributed representations can support sophisticated linguistic processing. The model was validated on human behavioral data including the typical length of response sequences and similarity relationships in produced responses. These data suggest two cognitive processes that are involved in solving the RAT: one process generates potential responses and a second process filters the responses.},

A mechanism that simplifies spatial infor-mation is described along with a small set of spatial primitives that are suf-ficient to account for the conceptualizations that preverbal infants use to interpret objects and events. This early system is important to understand because it organizes the adult conceptual system of objects and events and remains its core. With development, the system becomes enriched by lan-guage in several ways, and also by means of analogical extension to non-spatial information. Nonspatial bodily information, such as feelings of force and motor activity, is also added, but remains secondary. It becomes asso-ciated with spatial representations, but except for its spatial aspects is rep-resented in a more inchoate and less accessible fashion.},

However, even though the educational potential of games has been thoroughly discussed in the literature, the integration of the games into educational processes and how to efficiently deliver the games to the students are still open questions. This paper addresses the aspects of integration and automatic deployment of educational games in Learning Management Systems. This integration simplifies the introduction of games in educational settings, leveraging the pre-existing technological infrastructure. Our approach is based on the automatic packaging and exportation of games as self-contained Learning Objects that can be easily distributed through any LMS compliant with the current interoperability standards. We thus inherit the advantages of the Learning Object model in terms of interoperability and, when supported by the LMS, in terms of student tracking and assessment.},

Two key approaches to this problem are reinforcement learning (RL) and planning. This paper presents a survey of the integration of both fields, better known as model-based reinforcement learning. Model-based RL has two main steps. First, we systematically cover approaches to dynamics model learning, including challenges like dealing with stochasticity, uncertainty, partial observability, and temporal abstraction. Second, we present a systematic categorization of planning-learning integration, including aspects like: where to start planning, what budgets to allocate to planning and real data collection, how to plan, and how to integrate planning in the learning and acting loop. After these two key sections, we also discuss the potential benefits of model-based RL, like enhanced data efficiency, targeted exploration, and improved stability. Along the survey, we also draw connections to several related RL fields, like hierarchical RL and transfer, and other research disciplines, like behavioural psychology. Altogether, the survey presents a broad conceptual overview of planning-learning combinations for MDP optimization.},

	abstract = {The classic dichotomy between habitual and goal-directed behavior is often mapped onto a dichotomy between model-free and model-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, putatively implemented in segregated neuronal circuits. Despite significant heuristic value in motivating experimental investigations, several lines of evidence suggest that this mapping is in need of modification and/or realignment. First, whereas habitual and goal-directed behaviors have been shown to depend on cleanly separable neural circuitry, recent data suggest that model-based and model-free representations in the brain are largely overlapping. Second, habitual behaviors need not involve representations of expected reinforcement (i.e., need not involve RL, model-free, or otherwise) but may be based instead on simple stimulus–response associations. Finally, goal-directed decisions may not reflect a single model-based algorithm but rather a continuum of “model-basedness.” These lines of evidence thus suggest a possible reconceptualization of the distinction between model-free versus model-based RL—one in which both contribute to a single goal-directed system that is value-based, as opposed to distinct, habitual mechanisms that are value-free. In this chapter, we discuss new models that have extended the RL approach to modeling habitual and goal-directed behavior and assess how these have clarified our understanding of the underlying neural circuitry.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to bridge the process of scientific reasoning with the field of cognitive science, and more specifically, the cognitive mechanisms involved during reasoning. This intent of bridging scientific reasoning with cognitive mechanisms gave birth to a new model: the “Z” model of scientific reasoning. This model integrates the traditional scientific reasoning steps while depicting the cognitive mechanisms and mental flexibilities at use during reasoning. The goal of this experiment was to test the “Z” model and thus investigate the role of divergent and convergent thinking during scientific reasoning. In addition, the “Z” model highlights the importance of Contextual Focus during scientific reasoning. Contextual Focus is defined as the cognitive shift between modes of thoughts. Contextual Focus was tested to investigate its predictive power on our specific measure of scientific reasoning (Bouncing Ball Reasoning Task; BBRT) and a broader measure of scientific reasoning (Lawson Test of Scientific Reasoning; LTSR). In addition, the predictive power over scientific reasoning performances of Intellect and Openness, the personality traits of interest, was also tested. First, we hypothesized that participants experimentally primed to think divergently should perform better during the exploration of the problem space during a scientific reasoning task (Phase 1 of BBRT). As predicted, participants in the divergent thinking group generated on average more hypotheses than the participants in the convergent thinking and the control groups. Secondly, we hypothesized that participants experimentally primed to think convergently should perform better during the exploitation of the evaluative space during a scientific reasoning task (Phase 2 of BBRT). As predicted, participants in the convergent thinking group displayed on average fewer categorical errors than the participants in the divergent thinking or the control groups. In addition, Contextual Focus was found to be a significant predictor of the overall performance in exploring the problem space of our specific scientific reasoning problem. Intellect score over broader scientific reasoning (LTSR) performance, Contextual Focus and Intellect were found to be significant predictors of broader scientific reasoning (LTSR) performance. Those findings can also be interpreted with broader cognitive science lenses. Given that complex mental tasks such as problem solving and critical thinking also require divergent and convergent thinking, future research should test whether the priming used during our experimental protocol also leads to an advantage on more general reasoning tasks.},

A new problem fosters innovative and inventive solutions. Hence, it is expected that engineering design pedagogy and practice should equally focus on engineering design problem-exploring (EDPE)—a process of identifying or coming up with a new problem or need at the early-stage of design, and engineering design problem-solving (EDPS)—a process of developing engineering design solutions to a given problem. However, studies suggest that EDPE is scarcely practiced or given attention to in academia and industry, unlike EDPS. The aim of this paper is to investigate the EDPE process for any information relating to its scarce practice in academia and industry. This is to explore how emerging technologies could support the process. Natural models and phenomena that explain the EDPE process are investigated, including the “rational” and “garbage can” models, and associated challenges identified. A computational framework that mimics the natural EDPE process is presented. The framework is based on Markovian model and computational technologies, including machine learning. A case study is conducted with a sample size of 43 participants drawn worldwide from the engineering design community in academia and industry. The case study result shows that the first-of-its-kind computational EDPE framework presented in this paper supports both novice and experienced design engineers in EDPE.},

Two examples are used, one a typical problem solving activity (the Tower of Hanoi) and the other syllogistic reasoning. The latter is an example where the search behavior typical of problem spaces is not clearly in evidence, so it provides a useful area to explore the extension of the concept. A focal issue used in the chapter is the origin of the numerous flow diagrams that serve as theories of how subjects behave in tasks in the psychological laboratory.

Two particlar controllers have been identified, one associated with a forward model and the prefrontal cortex and a second associated with computationally simpler, habitual, actor-critic methods and part of the striatum. We argue here for the normative appropriateness of an additional, but so far marginalized control system, associated with episodic memory, and involving the hippocampus and medial temporal cortices. We analyze in depth a class of simple environments to show that episodic control should be useful in a range of cases characterized by complexity and inferential noise, and most particularly at the very early stages of learning, long before habitization has set in. We interpret data on the transfer of control from the hippocampus to the striatum in the light of this hypothesis.},

Sur la base d’une note de synthèse, trois innovations jugées particulièrement significatives pour la recherche ont tout d’abord été choisies. Les ressources documentaires et expérientielles les plus pertinentes au regard de ces innovations ont ensuite été recherchées et regroupées. Elles ont enfin été resituées dans leur contexte scientifique, historique, social et technologique spécifique puis analysées afin de comprendre les changements qu’elles ont ou non accompagnés et sur quelle temporalité.},

Our analysis of practical applications shows that most architectures are very narrowly focused on a particular application domain. Furthermore, there is an apparent gap between general research in robotics and computer vision and research in these areas within the cognitive architectures field. It is very clear that biologically inspired models do not have the same range and efficiency compared to the systems based on engineering principles and heuristics. Another observation is related to a general lack of collaboration. Several factors hinder communication, such as the closed nature of the individual projects (only one-third of the reviewed here architectures are open-source) and terminological differences.},

It is based on highly general ontological notions drawn from philosophy, like essence, identity, and unity, which are used to elicit and characterize the intended meaning of properties, classes, and relations making up an ontology. These aspects are represented by formal metaproperties, which impose several constraints on the taxonomic relationships between concepts. The analysis of these constraints helps in evaluating and validating the choices made. In this chapter we present an informal overview of the philosophical notions involved and their role in OntoClean, review some common ontological pitfalls, and walk through the example that has appeared in pieces in previous papers and has been the basis of numerous tutorials and talks.},

	abstract = {Behavioral skills or policies for autonomous agents are conventionally learned from reward functions, via reinforcement learning, or from demonstrations, via imitation learning. However, both modes of task speciﬁcation have their disadvantages: reward functions require manual engineering, while demonstrations require a human expert to be able to actually perform the task in order to generate the demonstration. Instruction following from natural language instructions provides an appealing alternative: in the same way that we can specify goals to other humans simply by speaking or writing, we would like to be able to specify tasks for our machines. However, a single instruction may be insufﬁcient to fully communicate our intent or, even if it is, may be insufﬁcient for an autonomous agent to actually understand how to perform the desired task. In this work, we propose an interactive formulation of the task speciﬁcation problem, where iterative language corrections are provided to an autonomous agent, guiding it in acquiring the desired skill. Our proposed language-guided policy learning algorithm can integrate an instruction and a sequence of corrections to acquire new skills very quickly. In our experiments, we show that this method can enable a policy to follow instructions and corrections for simulated navigation and manipulation tasks, substantially outperforming direct, non-interactive instruction following.},

(1992), qui s'inscrit dans le paradigme des théories du changement conceptuel. Nourri par les travaux récents des psychologues cognitifs sur les processus d'apprentissage tels que les théories du recyclage neuronal (Dehaene, 2007) ou de l'inhibition cérébrale (Houdé \& Tzourio-Mazoyer, 2003), ainsi que sur diverses théories relatives à l'élaboration de la pensée telles que l'économie comportementale (Tversky \& Kahnernan, 1982) ou le modèle-cadre SRK (Rasmussen, 1990), ce modèle développe et précise le concept d’allostérie à travers la description et la formalisation des processus de déconstruction-reconstruction des conceptions, qui ont lieu lors des apprentissages complexes. De la phase de théorisation du modèle, effectuée par un recours aux formalismes de la réactivité chimique en accord avec la métaphore initiale de l'allostérie, il est possible de déduire divers environnements didactiques opératoires et féconds pour le praticien de l'enseignement et de la médiation scientifiques. Ces prévisions théoriques sont alors mises à l'épreuve de l'expérimentation didactique à travers une recherche de terrain centrée sur la notion d'expérience contre-intuitive (Eastes \& Pellaud, 2004) menée auprès de différents types de publics.},

In particular, creative information exploration seeks to discover new, surprising and valuable relationships in data that would not be revealed by conventional information retrieval, data mining and data analysis technologies. While our approach is inspired by work in the field of computational creativity, we are particularly interested in a model of creativity proposed by Arthur Koestler in the 1960s. Koestler's model of creativity rests on the concept of bisociation. Bisociative thinking occurs when a problem, idea, event or situation is perceived simultaneously in two or more "matrices of thought" or domains. When two matrices of thought interact with each other, the result is either their fusion in a novel intellectual synthesis or their confrontation in a new aesthetic experience. This article discusses some of the foundational issues of computational creativity and bisociation in the context of creative information exploration.},

	abstract = {Le contrôle cognitif est la capacité à réagir à des stimuli de manière adaptée au contexte présent ou aux indices passés, en tenant compte de nos buts internes. Le contrôle cognitif et l'apprentissage entretiennent des liens profonds et réciproques. D'un côté, le contrôle cognitif requiert que nous ayons appris un répertoire de comportements ainsi que leur valeur dans différentes conditions, afin de les utiliser à bon escient. D'un autre côté, l'apprentissage d'un répertoire de comportements nécessite du contrôle cognitif, notamment pour réguler l'équilibre entre exploration et exploitation, mais également pour généraliser, décider d'un switch, induire une structure dans un problème, etc.. . . Le contrôle cognitif et l'apprentissage sont donc indissociablement liés dans la flexibilité qui carac- térise la fonction exécutive préfrontale humaine. Cependant, ce lien est actuellement mal compris et peu de travaux de psychologie ou neurosciences cognitives intègrent ces deux aspects. De même, les modèles computationnels d'apprentissage ou de décision existants ne rendent pas compte de leur interaction. Dans ce travail de thèse, nous proposons une théorie mathématique reposant sur des mécanismes d'apprentissage par renforcement et d'inférence bayésienne, qui intègre l'apprentissage de répertoires de comportements (task-sets) dans un milieu incertain et le contrôle cognitif (task-switching) en présence ou en l'absence d'information contextuelle. Cette théorie permet de faire des prédictions spécifiques que nous avons testées dans le cadre de deux expériences comportementales. Celles-ci ont permis de valider les prédictions de la théorie et d'invalider d'autres modèles existants. De plus, la théorie proposée permet d'avancer un facteur explicatif des différences qualitatives de stratégies d'exploration observées entre différents individus. La théorie proposée caractérise de façon intrinsèque des notions essentielles telles que le comporte- ment par défaut, le switch et l'exploration. Elle permet de faire émerger naturellement un mécanisme de contrôle du compromis exploitation - exploration, ainsi que son facteur de pondération. Enfin, les résultats empiriques valident les prédictions et confirment les hypothèses du modèle.

	title = {Guiding policies with language via meta-learning},
	abstract = {Behavioral skills or policies for autonomous agents are conventionally learned from reward functions, via reinforcement learning, or from demonstrations, via imitation learning. However, both modes of task speciﬁcation have their disadvantages: reward functions require manual engineering, while demonstrations require a human expert to be able to actually perform the task in order to generate the demonstration. Instruction following from natural language instructions provides an appealing alternative: in the same way that we can specify goals to other humans simply by speaking or writing, we would like to be able to specify tasks for our machines. However, a single instruction may be insufﬁcient to fully communicate our intent or, even if it is, may be insufﬁcient for an autonomous agent to actually understand how to perform the desired task. In this work, we propose an interactive formulation of the task speciﬁcation problem, where iterative language corrections are provided to an autonomous agent, guiding it in acquiring the desired skill. Our proposed language-guided policy learning algorithm can integrate an instruction and a sequence of corrections to acquire new skills very quickly. In our experiments, we show that this method can enable a policy to follow instructions and corrections for simulated navigation and manipulation tasks, substantially outperforming direct, non-interactive instruction following.},

	abstract = {Le cortex préfrontal est le siège de la fonction exécutive, la capacité cognitive de haut niveau qui permet aux humains d'agir non seulement en réaction aux stimuli externes mais aussi en fonction de buts internes. Dans cette thèse nous étudions l'interaction entre les processus cognitifs et motivationnels de la fonction exécutive. Nous proposons que le concept clef pour comprendre l'architecture fonctionnelle des cortex préfrontaux latéral et médian est la fenêtre temporelle d'intégration de l'information qui structure la séparation des processus de contrôle selon un axe caudo-rostral. Ainsi les régions préfrontales postérieures permettent l'adaptation du comportement immédiat sur la base des informations portées par le stimulus et son contexte. Les régions préfrontales moyennes sont impliquées dans le maitien d'un ensemble de règles comportementales et des valeurs qui leur sont associées au cours d'une même série d'essais. Pendant un embranchement cognitif, les cortex préfrontaux médians droit et gauche peuvent encoder séparément les valeurs associées à la tâche interrompue et à la tâche en cours. La région frontopolaire intègre ces valeurs et contrôle l'exécution d'une tâche double. Ainsi, les propriétés du cortex préfrontal médian et frontopolaire, qui limitent à deux le nombre de tâches conjointement traitées, pourraient néanmoins jouer un rôle fondamental dans la capacité à générer un comportement complexe en coordonnant la tâche présente et les buts futurs.},

A sample of 322 older adults (mean age = 72 years) attending Universities of the Third Age were administered the shortened version of a questionnaire aimed at capturing opinions and feelings associated to learning, a task from the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking, and the Satisfaction with Life Scale. Age, gender, schooling, occupation, marital status, and hobbies of the participants were taken into account. Factorial analyses showed that different conceptions of learning can be identified and that some of them are affected by age, gender, and the hobbies practised by the respondents. Older participants and women considered learning as an interpersonal and focused process to a larger extent. Older participants expressed negative feelings about learning, whereas women expressed positive feelings. Satisfaction with life changed according to marital status with married people scoring higher. Creative skills decreased with age and were influenced by gender, level of education, marital status, and hobbies practiced. Associations between conceptions of learning and satisfaction with life and creativity emerged. Implications for interventions addressing older adults’ well-being are discussed.},

	abstract = {En France au cours de ces dernières années, l'apprentissage de l'informatique (sous le terme d'« apprentissage du code ») est entré dans les programmes scolaires, en primaire et secondaire. Cet apprentissage vise notamment le développement de la pensée informatique (au sens défini par Wing) afin de permettre aux élèves, filles et garçons, d'acquérir les bases, une étape initiale vers la maîtrise du numérique, sous tous ses aspects (science, technologie, industrie et culture). Cependant, peu d'enseignant·e·s, ou de parents, ont été formé·e·s pour enseigner les sciences du numérique ou éduquer à leurs fondements et leurs usages. De plus, si le système éducatif avance progressivement au niveau de ces objectifs, dans la vie quotidienne et en contexte professionnel, il existe aussi un besoin de formation tout au long de la vie à la pensée informatique. Des projets d'envergure sur l'apprentissage du code sont aujourd'hui forts d'un véritable succès en matière de support à la formation des professionnel·le·s de l'éducation sur ces sujets. Cependant ces projets nécessitent une main d'oeuvre importante tant pour la création de ressources que pour leur actualisation, afin de rester en phase avec les besoins de formation dans un domaine en évolution constante. Dans le but de développer davantage les objectifs de démystification de la pensée informatique vers un large public de citoyens et de citoyennes, nous voulons questionner ici la manière dont il est possible de concevoir une initiative concrète et opérationnelle qui relève ce défi. Partageons ici une proposition et discutons-la. Ce qui est proposé porte un nom : une Université, Citoyenne en Sciences et Culture du Numérique (\#UCscN) qui s'inscrit dans la tradition des universités populaires. Il s'agit donc très simplement d'étendre à toutes et tous cette éducation pour penser l'informatique en capitalisant sur l'expérience acquise de Class'Code en formant les professionnel·le·s de l'éducation.},

The proposed pattern relies on the descriptions and situations ontology pattern, combined with a frame-based representation scheme. Inspired by the aﬀordance theory and behaviour-based robotics principles, our reference model enables the deﬁnition of weighted relationships, or aﬀordances, between situations (representing agent’s perception of the environmental and social context) and agent’s functional and behavioral abilities. These weighted links serve as a basis for supporting runtime task selection and arbitration policies, to dynamically and contextually select agent’s behaviour. The pattern is at the heart of the behaviour-based cognitive approach adopted in the EU H2020 MARIO project for the design of an autonomous service robot (i.e., the cognitive agent) to support elderly people with cognitive impairments.},

	abstract = {The interdisciplinary nature of STEM education is a fertile ground for the development of transversal competencies. The study of STEM activities requires not only to consider domain-specific knowledge and skills, but also to possess several transversal competences, among them problem-solving, creativity, and computational thinking to fully benefit from the learning process initiated by these activities. Considering these transversal competencies separately leads to several points of tensions, from a more integrative, holistic point of view. Hence, it is necessary to look at these aspects from a more transdisciplinary position, eventually overcoming limits of disciplinary-orientated approaches, thus linking the existing theoretical frameworks and pedagogical practices. In this article, we describe how the techno-creative problem-solving framework (TCPS) could enrich the analysis of STEM teaching and learning from a transversal epistemological and didactical position. In order to investigate the transdisciplinary potential of TCPS, we provide the analysis of two problem-solving tasks, Tower of Hanoi and CreaCube. The analysis of these tasks through the TCPS raises the existing tensions on how problem-solving, creativity, and computational thinking are considered in different domains to highlight commonalities and differences between different approaches and to deepen the discussion about their possible connections.},

We analyze problem-solving in the continuation of Sannino and Laitinen’s (2015) approach to the analysis of a decision-forming apparatus. The originality of this study is in consideration of the materialistic nature of double stimulation that appears during the activity of the CreaCube problem-solving task. This activity engages the participant in solving tasks with interactive robotic instruments. To solve a task, the subject is required to build interactive robotic modules into a specific configuration which will cause the artifact to move from an initial position to a predetermined final position. The conflict of stimuli in the CreaCube is strong and observable because of the tangibility of the artifact, which is manipulated by the participant into different configurations with the goal of solving the task. We discuss double stimulation in relation to the artifactual interactive affordances of educational robotics.},

	abstract = {Semialgebraic geometry is the study of sets of real solutions of systems of polynomial equations and inequalities. These notes present the first results of semialgebraic geometry and related algorithmic issues. Their content is by no means original.

The first chapter explains algorithms for counting real roots (this is, in some sense, 0-dimensional semialgebraic geometry) and the Tarski-Seidenberg theorem.
In the next two chapters we study semialgebraic subsets of Rn, which are defined by boolean combinations of polynomial equations and inequalities. The main tool for this study is the cylindrical algebraic decomposition, which is
introduced in Chapter 2. The principal result of Chapter 3 is the triangulation theorem. This theorem shows that semialgebraic sets have a simple topology, which can be effectively computed from their definitions.
Chapter 4 contains examples of finiteness results and uniform bounds for semialgebraic families. In particular, we give an explicit bound for the number of connected components of a real algebraic set as a function of the degree of the equations and the dimension of the ambient space.
Many results of semialgebraic geometry also hold true for o-minimal structures (including for instance classes of sets definable with the exponential functions). See [D] (or the lecture notes [Co]) for this theory. The algorithmic aspects are specific to the semialgebraic case.
The bibliography is reduced to a minimum, containing mainly books and recent surveys. Further references (in particular, references to original papers) may be found there.

These notes have served as a basis for courses in Rennes, Paris and Pisa, for mini-courses at MSRI (Berkeley), at a summer school in Laredo (Cantabria) and at a CIMPA school in Niamey.},

systèmes de stockages des données, logiciels généraux et spécialisés, réseaux en tout genre, etc. Pour conduire et maîtriser ce développement, sans aucun équivalent dans l'histoire de l'humanité, les mathématiques -et donc en particulier l'informatique théorique- ont élaboré toutes sortes d'idées et ont avancé de nombreux
résultats qui renouvellent notre perception du monde: algorithmes, classes de complexités, méthodes de démonstration automatique, techniques de compression de données, notions abstraites nouvelles permettant de définir, d'évaluer et d'utiliser les objets complexes, spéculations déconcertantes et pourtant sérieuses, etc.

C'est à ces aspects des complexités, associant informatique et mathématiques, qu'est consacré cet ouvrage. Il a été constitué à partir d'articles parus dans la revue Pour la Science (rubrique« Logique et calcul»), articles qui ont été classés, corrigés, mis à jour, et complétés. La bibliographie et la liste des liens Internet ont été refaites.
Même si nous proposons des renvois d'un chapitre à l'autre lorsque cela peut faciliter la compréhension, nous avons préservé l'indépendance de chaque texte. La lecture du livre peut donc être menée dans l'ordre qu'on juge le meilleur pour soi. Chaque chapitre se présente comme un tout qu'on peut aborder sans prépa-
ration particulière avec le bagage scientifique que donne une classe de terminale. Cette volonté de modularité et d'accessibilité justifiera peut-être certaines répétitions.

À lire ces chapitres, vous aurez parfois l'impression de vous trouver dans un roman de science-fiction; non, il s'agit simplement du monde réel d'aujourd'hui qui, dans le tourbillon de toutes les complexités, évolue à la vitesse des giga-octets d'information dans nos câbles électriques et optiques, - vitesse, on le sait, proche de celle de la lumière.},

He goes on to argue that Deacon’s thesis on the co-evolution of language and mind would beneﬁt from an integrational approach. This paper argues that Cowley’s criticism relies on an invalid understanding of Deacon’s use the concept of ‘‘symbolic reference’’, which he appropriates from Peirce’s semiotic. Peirce’s analysis as well as Deacon’s appropriation will be examined in detail. Consequently it will be argued that an integrationist reading would add very little to Deacon’s core thesis.},

In this review, I consider the current state of knowledge of how rules are learned, stored in the brain, and retrieved and used as the need arises. The focus is primarily on studies in humans, but the review is informed by relevant studies in nonhuman primates. Ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) has been implicated in rule learning, retrieval from long-term memory, and on-line maintenance during task preparation. Interactions between VLPFC and temporal cortex are required for rule retrieval in nonhuman primates, and brain imaging findings in humans suggest that rule knowledge is stored in the posterior middle temporal gyrus. Dorsolateral PFC appears to be more closely related to rule-based response selection than to rule retrieval. An important task for the future is to explain how PFC, basal ganglia, and temporal, parietal, and motor cortices interact to produce rule-guided behavior.},

In this paper, we pursue the possibility that the central mechanism associated with this effect might be a reduced capacity to exert inhibition. We tested this hypothesis by exhausting the inhibition efficiency through prolonged and intensive practice of either the Simon or the Eriksen Flanker task. Performance on another inhibition task indicated that only the cognitive resources for inhibition of participants facing high inhibition demands were impaired. Subsequent creativity tests revealed that exposure to high inhibition demands led to enhanced fluency in a divergent thinking task (Alternate Uses Task), but no such changes occurred in a convergent task (Remote Associate Task; studies 1a and 1b). The same manipulation also led to a hyper-priming effect for weakly related primes in a Lexical Decision Task (Study 2). Together, these findings suggest that inhibition selectively affects some types of creative processes and that, when resources for inhibition are lacking, the frequency and the originality of ideas was facilitated.},

Weekly observations of 194 students (4th–6th grade) were conducted in three classrooms, over 3 years. Supplemental data were collected from student-written journals. Data were coded for themes. The findings revealed that the robotics classrooms were characterized by a high degree of energy. The students worked intensely on robotic tasks, engaging in a two-stage creative process that involved first designing a robot with a preplanned or spontaneous work approach, followed by an iterative period of trial and error creative programming. A variety of creativity techniques were observed being used. The SRI was shown to develop creative behavior in the students through the myriad of creative robot products generated. Based on the findings, the authors propose a componential model for developing creative behavior in the students through robotics, which includes a set of social, psychological, and physical elements necessary for the students to produce creative results in school robotics programs.},

This article stems from a research project that occurred at a Preparatory to Year 9 school in Australia where we worked with staff to explore their understandings of creativity and creative learning in the Arts. We found that while students’ creative learning is a fundamental element in a creative pedagogy framework, the notion of creative learning of teachers is largely overlooked in discourses of teachers’ professional learning. Given the important role teachers play in student learning, we argue that teachers need to be informed not only about how to teach creatively and for creativity, but also how to consider possibilities and understand things in new ways, thereby making a case that a teacher’s own creative learning is crucial.},

Results from confirmatory factor analysis, using a different sample (N= 106 teams from the Norwegian public postal service), suggested that the five-factor solution had the most parsimonious fit.

Such cognitive spatio-temporal processes can be represented by a set of sequential metastable dynamical states together with their associated transitions: The state is quasi-stationary close to one metastable state before a rapid transition to another state. Hence, we postulate that metastable states are the central players in cognitive information processing. Based on the analogy of quasiparticles as elementary units in physics, we introduce here the quantum of cognitive information dynamics, which we term “cognon”. A cognon, or dynamical unit of thought, is represented by a robust finite chain of metastable neural states. Cognons can be organized at multiple hierarchical levels and coordinate complex cognitive information representations. Since a cognon is an abstract conceptualization, we link this abstraction to brain sequential dynamics that can be measured using common modalities and argue that cognons and brain rhythms form binding spatiotemporal complexes to keep simultaneous dynamical information which relate the ‘what’, ‘where’ and ‘when’.},

Therefore, this study aims to provide a survey of the state-of-the-art semantic networks for engineering design and propositions of future research to build and utilize large-scale semantic networks as knowledge bases to support engineering design research and practice. The survey shows that WordNet, ConceptNet, and other semantic networks, which contain common-sense knowledge or are trained on non-engineering data sources, are primarily used by engineering design researchers to develop methods and tools. Meanwhile, there are emerging efforts in constructing engineering and technical-contextualized semantic network databases, such as B-Link and TechNet, through retrieving data from technical data sources and employing unsupervised machine learning approaches. On this basis, we recommend six strategic future research directions to advance the development and uses of large-scale semantic networks for artificial intelligence applications in engineering design.},

This approach employs a research framework called ?constructive simulation?, which may be effective for investigating a process that is difficult to observe both internally and externally. The simulation was conducted in four phases. In Phase 1, the virtual concept generation process was constructed on a semantic network. In Phase 2, the relevance of the process was confirmed using network theory. In Phase 3, the simulation was validated using ?synthetic verification? which confirms the relevance of the process with another real-life phenomenon, as well as the feasibility of creating more creative design ideas. In Phase 4, the characteristics or patterns in the actual concept generation process were inferred from those of the virtual concept generation process. The results suggest that thinking patterns in which explicit and ?inexplicit? concepts are continuously intertwined lead to creative design ideas.},

It is required in the aspects of problem-solving - conceptualizing a new solution to a problem, and problem-exploring - conceptualizing a new problem. Studies show that, in both aspects, creativity is a difficult task in practice. The aim of this study is to support the engineering design community by easing the difficulty in the problem-exploring practice. To achieve this, a computational problem-exploring (CPE) model is developed to mimic how design engineers identify a valid design problem. Consequently, a CPE tool - Pro-Explora V1 is developed based on the CPE model. The CPE model consists of a synergy of emergent computational technologies including data retrieval and machine learning. A Markovian model is employed in the CPE model to enable a data-driven random process for exploring design problems. In pilot test, Pro-Explora V1 generated some engineering design-related problems which are meaningful, unique, and could not be distinguished from naturally generated ones. It provides support to design engineers in problem-exploring at the early stage in engineering design.

Substantial and sustained study on creativity has been undertaken, and much is now known about the fundamentals and how creativity can be augmented. To draw these elements together, a framework was developed called the creativity diamond, formulated on the basis of reviews of prior work, as well as the consideration of 20 PhD studies on the topics of creativity, design, innovation, and product development. The framework embodies the principles that quantity of ideas breeds quality through selection, and that a range of creativity tools can provoke additional ideas to augment our innate creativity. The creativity diamond proposed is a tool consisting of a divergent phase associated with the development of many distinctive ideas and a convergent phase associated with the refinement of ideas. The creativity diamond framework can be used to prompt and help select which tool or approach to use in a creative environment for innovative tasks. The framework has now been used by many students and professionals in diverse contexts.},

	abstract = {In recent years deep reinforcement learning (RL) systems have attained superhuman performance in a number of challenging task domains. However, a major limitation of such applications is their demand for massive amounts of training data. A critical present objective is thus to develop deep RL methods that can adapt rapidly to new tasks. In the present work we introduce a novel approach to this challenge, which we refer to as deep meta-reinforcement learning. Previous work has shown that recurrent networks can support meta-learning in a fully supervised context. We extend this approach to the RL setting. What emerges is a system that is trained using one RL algorithm, but whose recurrent dynamics implement a second, quite separate RL procedure. This second, learned RL algorithm can differ from the original one in arbitrary ways. Importantly, because it is learned, it is configured to exploit structure in the training domain. We unpack these points in a series of seven proof-of-concept experiments, each of which examines a key aspect of deep meta-RL. We consider prospects for extending and scaling up the approach, and also point out some potentially important implications for neuroscience.},

	abstract = {Research in Neuroscience, as in many scientific disciplines, is undergoing a renaissance based on deep learning. Unique to Neuroscience, deep learning models can be used not only as a tool but interpreted as models of the brain. The central claims of recent deep learning-based models of brain circuits are that they make novel predictions about neural phenomena or shed light on the fundamental functions being optimized. We show, through the case-study of grid cells in the entorhinal-hippocampal circuit, that one may get neither. We begin by reviewing the principles of grid cell mechanism and function obtained from first-principles modeling efforts, then rigorously examine the claims of deep learning models of grid cells. Using large-scale architectural and hyperparameter sweeps and theory-driven experimentation, we demonstrate that the results of such models may be more strongly driven by particular, non-fundamental, and post-hoc implementation choices than fundamental truths about neural circuits or the loss function(s) they might optimize. We discuss why these models cannot be expected to produce accurate models of the brain without the addition of substantial amounts of inductive bias, an informal No Free Lunch result for Neuroscience. Based on first principles work, we provide hypotheses for what additional loss functions will produce grid cells more robustly. In conclusion, circumspection and transparency, together with biological knowledge, are warranted in building and interpreting deep learning models in Neuroscience.},

	abstract = {Several psychophysical studies on human problem solving were performed. These studies involved the following problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem, the 15-puzzle and variants of this puzzle with different sizes, and finally, the TSP with obstacles. All these problems are difficult combinatorial problems and are considered intractable. However, human subjects were found to produce near-optimal solutions very quickly. For all these problems, a pyramid algorithm was used as a model of the mental representation of the problem, and of the global-to-local process of producing the solution. This approach represents a paradigm shift in the study of human problem solving because the prior research (1) neglected mental representation of problems and (2) it concentrated on easy problems that are not solved well by humans. As a part of this project, a workshop on human problem solving was held at Purdue. After the workshop, a new journal was launched. This is the first journal dedicated to human problem solving.},

	abstract = {1 Why develop an ontology? In recent years the development of ontologies—explicit formal specifications of the terms in the domain and relations among them (Gruber 1993)—has been moving from the realm of ArtificialIntelligence laboratories to the desktops of domain experts. Ontologies have become common on the World-Wide Web. The ontologies on the Web range from large taxonomies categorizing Web sites (such as on Yahoo!) to categorizations of products for sale and their features (such as on Amazon.com). The WWW Consortium (W3C) is developing the Resource Description Framework (Brickley and Guha 1999), a language for encoding knowledge on Web pages to make it understandable to electronic agents searching for information. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), in conjunction with the W3C, is developing DARPA Agent Markup Language (DAML) by extending RDF with more expressive constructs aimed at facilitating agent interaction on the Web (Hendler and McGuinness 2000). Many disciplines now develop standardized ontologies that domain experts can use to share and annotate information in their fields. Medicine, for example, has produced large, standardized, structured vocabularies such as SNOMED (Price and Spackman 2000) and the semantic network of the Unified Medical Language System (Humphreys and Lindberg 1993). Broad general-purpose ontologies are emerging as well. For example, the United Nations Development Program and Dun \&amp; Bradstreet combined their efforts to develop the UNSPSC ontology which provides terminology for products and services (www.unspsc.org). An ontology defines a common vocabulary for researchers who need to share information in a domain. It includes machine-interpretable definitions of basic concepts in the domain and relations among them. Why would someone want to develop an ontology? Some of the reasons are:},

	abstract = {Deep Reinforcement Learning (deep RL) has made several breakthroughs in recent years in applications ranging from complex control tasks in unmanned vehicles to game playing. Despite their success, deep RL still lacks several important capacities of human intelligence, such as transfer learning, abstraction and interpretability. Deep Symbolic Reinforcement Learning (DSRL) seeks to incorporate such capacities to deep Q-networks (DQN) by learning a relevant symbolic representation prior to using Q-learning. In this paper, we propose a novel extension of DSRL, which we call Symbolic Reinforcement Learning with Common Sense (SRL+CS), offering a better balance between generalization and specialization, inspired by principles of common sense when assigning rewards and aggregating Q-values. Experiments reported in this paper show that SRL+CS learns consistently faster than Q-learning and DSRL, achieving also a higher accuracy. In the hardest case, where agents were trained in a deterministic environment and tested in a random environment, SRL+CS achieves nearly 100\% average accuracy compared to DSRL's 70\% and DQN's 50\% accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of near perfect zero-shot transfer learning using Reinforcement Learning.},

Neurosymbolic computing has been an active area of research for many years seeking to bring together robust learning in neural networks with reasoning and explainability by offering symbolic representations for neural models. In this paper, we relate recent and early research in neurosymbolic AI with the objective of identifying the most important ingredients of neurosymbolic AI systems. We focus on research that integrates in a principled way neural network-based learning with symbolic knowledge representation and logical reasoning.

There are many studies corroborating these trends, but does this translate into an exponential increase in energy consumption? In order to answer this question we focus on inference costs rather than training costs, as the former account for most of the computing effort, solely because of the multiplicative factors. Also, apart from algorithmic innovations, we account for more specific and powerful hardware (leading to higher FLOPS) that is usually accompanied with important energy efficiency optimisations. We also move the focus from the first implementation of a breakthrough paper towards the consolidated version of the techniques one or two year later. Under this distinctive and comprehensive perspective, we study relevant models in the areas of computer vision and natural language processing: for a sustained increase in performance we see a much softer growth in energy consumption than previously anticipated. The only caveat is, yet again, the multiplicative factor, as future AI increases penetration and becomes more pervasive.},

We then introduce a statistical method to decompose, through the lens of GPT-2's activations, the brain activity of 345 subjects recorded with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the listening of {\textasciitilde}4.6 hours of narrated text. The results highlight two findings. First, compositional representations recruit a more widespread cortical network than lexical ones, and encompass the bilateral temporal, parietal and prefrontal cortices. Second, contrary to previous claims, syntax and semantics are not associated with separated modules, but, instead, appear to share a common and distributed neural substrate. Overall, this study introduces a versatile framework to isolate, in the brain activity, the distributed representations of linguistic constructs.},

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved tremendous success in many complex decision making tasks. When it comes to deploying RL in the real world, safety concerns are usually raised, leading to a growing demand for safe RL algorithms, such as in autonomous driving and robotics scenarios. While safety control has a long history, the study of safe RL algorithms is still in the early stages. To establish a good foundation for future research in this thread, in this paper, we provide a review for safe RL from the perspectives of methods, theory and applications. Firstly, we review the progress of safe RL from five dimensions and come up with five problems that are crucial for safe RL being deployed in real-world applications, coined as "2H3W". Secondly, we analyze the theory and algorithm progress from the perspectives of answering the "2H3W" problems. Then, the sample complexity of safe RL methods is reviewed and discussed, followed by an introduction of the applications and benchmarks of safe RL algorithms. Finally, we open the discussion of the challenging problems in safe RL, hoping to inspire more future research on this thread. To advance the study of safe RL algorithms, we release a benchmark suite, an open-sourced repository containing the implementations of major safe RL algorithms, along with tutorials at the link: https://github.com/chauncygu/Safe-Reinforcement-Learning-Baselines.git.},

In path planning, safety is important issue that should be taken into account in order to ensure a robot reaches at the target location without collision with surrounding obstacles. Moreover, there are important aspects that need to be addressed in path planning; computational time, optimal path and completeness. One of the popular methods for path planning is Potential field. Potential filed method is capable to overcome unknown scenario, taking into account the realities of the current environment of the robot motion. Two type of forces involved in potential field method; attractive force generated by goals and repulsive force generated by obstacles. However, this method has a major drawback due to local minima problem. This paper reviews the traditional artificial potential field theory that has been modified with variety of algorithms based on potential field method that have been implemented to upgrade the potential function performance in obstacle avoidance and local minima problem.},

Sketches annotate tasks with sequences of named subtasks, providing information about high-level structural relationships among tasks but not how to implement them—specifically not providing the detailed guidance used by much previous work on learning policy abstractions for RL (e.g. intermediate rewards, subtask completion signals, or intrinsic motivations). To learn from sketches, we present a model that associates every subtask with a modular subpolicy, and jointly maximizes reward over full task-specific policies by tying parameters across shared subpolicies. Optimization is accomplished via a decoupled actor–critic training objective that facilitates learning common behaviors from multiple dissimilar reward functions. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in three environments featuring both discrete and continuous control, and with sparse rewards that can be obtained only after completing a number of high-level subgoals. Experiments show that using our approach to learn policies guided by sketches gives better performance than existing techniques for learning task-specific or shared policies, while naturally inducing a library of interpretable primitive behaviors that can be recombined to rapidly adapt to new tasks.},

	abstract = {There is an overwhelming archeological and genetic evidence that modern speech apparatus was acquired by hominins by 600,000 years ago. On the other hand, artifacts signifying modern imagination, such as (1) composite figurative arts, (2) bone needles with an eye, (3) construction of dwellings, and (4) elaborate burials arose not earlier than 70,000 years ago. It remains unclear (1) why there was a long gap between acquisition of modern speech apparatus and modern imagination, (2) what triggered the acquisition of modern imagination 70,000 years ago, and (3) what role language might have played in this process. Our research into evolutionary origin of modern imagination has been driven by the observation of a temporal limit for the development of a particular component of imagination. Modern children not exposed to recursive language in early childhood never acquire the type of active constructive imagination called Prefrontal Synthesis (PFS). Unlike vocabulary and grammar acquisition, which can be learned throughout one’s lifetime, there is a strong critical period for the development of PFS and individuals not exposed to recursive language in early childhood can never acquire PFS as adults. Their language will always lack understanding of spatial prepositions and recursion that depend on the PFS ability. In a similar manner, early hominins would not have been able to learn recursive language as adults and, therefore, would not be able to teach recursive language to their children. Thus, the existence of a strong critical period for PFS acquisition creates an evolutionary barrier for behavioral modernity. An evolutionary mathematical model suggests that a synergistic confluence of three events (1) a genetic mutation that extended the critical period by slowing down the prefrontal cortex development simultaneously in two or more children, (2) invention of recursive elements of language, such as spatial prepositions, by these children and (3) their dialogic communications using these recursive elements, resulted in concurrent conversion of a non-recursive communication system of their parents to recursive language and acquisition of PFS around 70,000 years ago.},

It has long been unclear whether different cognitive and neural processes lead to insight versus noninsight solutions, or if solutions differ only in subsequent subjective feeling. Recent behavioral studies indicate distinct patterns of performance and suggest differential hemispheric involvement for insight and noninsight solutions. Subjects solved verbal problems, and after each correct solution indicated whether they solved with or without insight. We observed two objective neural correlates of insight. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (Experiment 1) revealed increased activity in the right hemisphere anterior superior temporal gyrus for insight relative to noninsight solutions. The same region was active during initial solving efforts. Scalp electroencephalogram recordings (Experiment 2) revealed a sudden burst of high-frequency (gamma-band) neural activity in the same area beginning 0.3 s prior to insight solutions. This right anterior temporal area is associated with making connections across distantly related information during comprehension. Although all problem solving relies on a largely shared cortical network, the sudden flash of insight occurs when solvers engage distinct neural and cognitive processes that allow them to see connections that previously eluded them.},

declarative memory. Given this functionality, we hypothesized that hippocampus
would play a critical role in creative thinking. We examined creative thinking,
as measured by verbal and figural forms of the Torrance Tests of Creative
Thinking (TTCT), in a group of participants with hippocampal damage and severe
declarative memory impairment as well as in a group of demographically matched
healthy comparison participants. The patients with bilateral hippocampal damage
performed significantly worse than comparison participants on both the verbal

a role critical in creative thinking, adding to a growing body of work pointing
to the diverse ways the hallmark processing features of hippocampus serve a
variety of behaviors that require flexible cognition.},

Recent work with discrimination-network computational models of long- and short-term memory (EPAM/CHREST) has produced a diverse range of applications of perceptual chunking.

These tools have long been used for applications in computer vision, for example optimal 3D alignment problems solved by orthogonal Procrustes, rotation averaging, or Essential matrix decomposition. Despite its utility in different settings, SVD orthogonalization as a procedure for producing rotation matrices is typically overlooked in deep learning models, where the preferences tend toward classic representations like unit quaternions, Euler angles, and axis-angle, or more recently-introduced methods. Despite the importance of 3D rotations in computer vision and robotics, a single universally effective representation is still missing. Here, we explore the viability of SVD orthogonalization for 3D rotations in neural networks. We present a theoretical analysis of SVD as used for projection onto the rotation group. Our extensive quantitative analysis shows simply replacing existing representations with the SVD orthogonalization procedure obtains state of the art performance in many deep learning applications covering both supervised and unsupervised training.},

We also use explicitation interviews and self-confrontation techniques to identify the tacit elements in actors’ activities, such as the concepts of situation, know-how and know-that, which constitute our ontology for knowledge acquisition.},

We propose that metacognitive skill learning can be largely explained by the skill acquisition model advanced by Fitts (1964) and Anderson (2013). While this model has been successful in the domains of motor skill and cognitive skill, it has not yet been applied to metacognitive skill. This novel framework can help to explain metacognitive skill learning, its cognitive underpinnings, and shed light on otherwise unexplainable empirical data.},

	abstract = {We demonstrate that the key components of cognitive architectures (declarative and procedural memory) and their key capabilities (learning, memory retrieval, probability judgment, and utility estimation) can be implemented as algebraic operations on vectors and tensors in a high-dimensional space using a distributional semantics model. High-dimensional vector spaces underlie the success of modern machine learning techniques based on deep learning. However, while neural networks have an impressive ability to process data to find patterns, they do not typically model high-level cognition, and it is often unclear how they work. Symbolic cognitive architectures can capture the complexities of high-level cognition and provide human-readable, explainable models, but scale poorly to naturalistic, non-symbolic, or big data. Vector-symbolic architectures, where symbols are represented as vectors, bridge the gap between the two approaches. We posit that cognitive architectures, if implemented in a vector-space model, represent a useful, explanatory model of the internal representations of otherwise opaque neural architectures. Our proposed model, Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM), is a vector-space model based on distributional semantics. HDM accounts for primacy and recency effects in free recall, the fan effect in recognition, probability judgments, and human performance on an iterated decision task. HDM provides a flexible, scalable alternative to symbolic cognitive architectures at a level of description that bridges symbolic, quantum, and neural models of cognition.},

While Content and Language Integrated Learning (CLIL) works because it focuses both on content and on foreign language learning, approaches aiming at transmitting academic content through a foreign language should not be implemented without explicit foreign language instructional support. Based on cognitive load theory, there are theoretical reasons to hypothesize that exposure to new content in a foreign language without any foreign language instructional support may interfere with rather than facilitate learning compared to learning language and content separately. In three experiments conducted in higher education, a text was presented to 294 students in three different conditions: native language, foreign language, and foreign language with a translation into the native language. We varied the foreign language (English, German) and the domain (Law, Computer Science). Our results indicated that reading in the foreign language was never the best condition to learn either language or academic content. We concluded that considerable care should be taken when transmitting academic content in a foreign language, without explicit foreign language instructional support.},

Secondary knowledge is the knowledge for which our cognitive architecture has not had enough time to evolve: it requires time, cognitive resources and is hardly motivating. This study proposed to test these evolutionary characteristics using the experimental paradigm of logical reasoning. We conducted five experiments (n = 720) varying (i) the content of syllogisms (primary or secondary knowledge), (ii) the presentation order of the knowledge types, (iii) the added extrinsic cognitive load, and (iv) the type of syllogism. Results showed that primary knowledge increased performance, emotional and cognitive investment and decreased perceived cognitive load. Second, presenting primary knowledge first would encourage participants to be motivated throughout the task, while presenting secondary knowledge first would undermine their motivation. Third, secondary knowledge seemed to lead to a feeling of conflict that consumed cognitive resources. All together, these results suggested that primary knowledge should be taken into account and not left aside because it is something “already learned”.},

	abstract = {Tests in non-Western cultures often reveal either a slower acquisition of conservation skills or a general inability to conserve. While many research efforts correlate conservation with formal schooling, more fundamental social and cultural influences are at work. Success in performing conservation tasks depends on familiarity with methods of analyzing the physical world that are not pan-cultural. Piagetian tasks are rooted in current scientific paradigms. These paradigms constitute cultural conventions integral to Western world views, conventions to which a great many cultures do not yet adhere. The theory of genetic epistemology assumes that the view derived from adherence to such paradigms is correct, and therefore contains an inherent cultural bias. To clarify the cultural and epistemological factors which contribute to test performance, two broad modes of cognition, based on cultural differences in beliefs and values, are suggested: the mythicomagical and the empiricoscientific. While the cognitive skills involved in Piagetian conservation are derived from an empiricoscientific mode, they may undergo negative reinforcement in cognitive domains characterized by the mythicomagical mode. While one or the other mode may be found to be predominant within a given culture, these modes of cognition more aptly describe the kind of thinking in emically defined cognitive domains.},

	abstract = {The twenty years since the publication of the first edition of this book have seen tremendous progress in artificial intelligence, propelled in large part by advances in machine learning, including advances in reinforcement learning. The authors goal for the second edition is to provide a clear and simple account of the key ideas and algorithms of reinforcement learning that is accessible to readers in all the related disciplines. The edition remains an introduction, and the authors retain a focus on core, online learning algorithms. This edition includes some new topics that rose to importance over the intervening years, and the authors expanded coverage of topics that they now understand better. The second edition is significantly expanded, and its top-level organization has been changed. After the introductory first chapter, the second edition is divided into three new parts. The first part treats as much of reinforcement learning as possible without going beyond the tabular case for which exact solutions can be found. The second part is then devoted to extending the ideas to function approximation. It has new sections on artificial neural networks, the fourier basis, Least-Squares temporal-difference, kernel-based methods, Gradient- temporal-difference and Emphatic- temporal-difference methods, average-reward methods, true online temporal-difference (A), and policy-gradient methods. The second edition significantly expands the treatment of off-policy learning. Another change is that the second edition separates the forward-view idea of n-step bootstrapping from the backward-view idea of eligibility traces. The third part of the book has large new chapters on reinforcement learning's relationships to psychology and neuroscience, as well as an updated case-studies chapter including Atari game playing, Watson's wagering strategy, and the Go playing programs AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero. This book is designed to be used as the primary text for a one- or two-semester course on reinforcement learning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Increasing evidence suggests that specific memory systems (e.g., semantic vs. episodic) may support specific creative thought processes. However, there are a number of inconsistencies in the literature regarding the strength, direction, and influence of different memory (semantic, episodic, working, and short-term) and creativity (divergent and convergent thinking) types, as well as the influence of external factors (age, stimuli modality) on this purported relationship. In this meta-analysis, we examined 525 correlations from 79 published studies and unpublished datasets, representing data from 12,846 individual participants. We found a small but significant (r = .19) correlation between memory and creative cognition. Among semantic, episodic, working, and short-term memory, all correlations were significant, but semantic memory - particularly verbal fluency, the ability to strategically retrieve information from long-term memory - was found to drive this relationship. Further, working memory capacity was found to be more strongly related to convergent than divergent creative thinking. We also found that within visual creativity, the relationship with visual memory was greater than that of verbal memory, but within verbal creativity, the relationship with verbal memory was greater than that of visual memory. Finally, the memory-creativity correlation was larger for children compared to young adults despite no impact of age on the overall effect size. These results yield three key conclusions: (1) semantic memory supports both verbal and nonverbal creative thinking, (2) working memory supports convergent creative thinking, and (3) the cognitive control of memory is central to performance on creative thinking tasks.},

	abstract = {One of the most important questions that educators try to answer is how to prepare new generations of students for an unpredictable future. Students need to learn several skills, such as creativity, critical thinking, collaboration, and communication (the 4 Cs). Creativity, especially, is an essential skill in a complex and unforeseeable world/era, and an important step in any effort to enhance creativity is to identify students’ creative strengths and relative weaknesses. This review aims to offer school psychologists and other educators such as teachers, policymakers, and curriculum designers a comprehensive and practical guide to one of the most well-known creativity assessments—the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT) that was developed by E. Paul Torrance in the 1960s. The paper discusses the history, components, training, psychometric properties, and uses of the TTCT. Contrary to the notion that the TTCT is only a measure of divergent thinking skills, the current article presents its other uses. It is the authors’ hope that teachers, school psychologists, and other educators will find the information reported in this article useful to better understand the TTCT and use it most effectively.},

Reston, VA: Council on Exceptional Children) suggested fluency, flexibility, originality and elaboration are the main cognitive processes used to define and assess creativity. However, data from several empirical studies did not confirm a factor structure in accordance with such cognitive functions, despite of the wide use of TTCT (Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking) in different countries. In this paper, we present new data collected in Spain and Portugal with TTCT. According to our data, those cognitive functions supposedly present on a subject's performance are not so strong as to explain the variance in scores. Elaboration factors assume some variance explanation, but the main factors are identified with the products in each subtest, suggesting the importance of format, content and demand on TTCT specific tasks. Consequently, we suggest some reflections to amplify the debate concerning the definition of creativity and its evaluation in psychology.},

While previous studies demonstrated the positive influence of motivation on creative abilities, how reward and subjective values play a role in creativity remains unknown. This study proposes to characterize the role of individual preferences (how people value ideas) in creative ideation via behavioral experiments and computational modeling. Using the Free Generation of Associates Task coupled with rating tasks, we demonstrate the involvement of valuation processes during idea generation: Preferred ideas are provided faster. We found that valuation depends on the adequacy and originality of ideas and guides response selection and creativity. Finally, our computational model correctly predicts the speed and quality of human creative responses, as well as interindividual differences in creative abilities. Altogether, this model introduces the mechanistic role of valuation in creativity. It paves the way for a neurocomputational account of creativity mechanisms.

	abstract = {BackgroundTo produce and understand words, humans access the mental lexicon. From a functional perspective, the long-term memory component of the mental lexicon is comprised of three levels: the concept level, the lemma level, and the phonological level. At each level, different kinds of word information are stored. Semantic as well as phonological cues can help to facilitate word access during a naming task, especially when neural dysfunctions are present. The processing corresponding to word access occurs in specific parts of working memory. Neural models for simulating speech processing help to uncover the complex relationships that exist between neural dysfunctions and corresponding behavioral patterns.MethodsThe Neural Engineering Framework (NEF) and the Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA) are used to develop a quantitative neural model of the mental lexicon and its access during speech processing. By simulating a picture-naming task (WWT 6-10), the influence of cues is investigated by introducing neural dysfunctions within the neural model at different levels of the mental lexicon.ResultsFirst, the neural model is able to simulate the test behavior for normal children that exhibit no lexical dysfunction. Second, the model shows worse results in test performance as larger degrees of dysfunction are introduced. Third, if the severity of dysfunction is not too high, phonological and semantic cues are observed to lead to an increase in the number of correctly named words. Phonological cues are observed to be more effective than semantic cues.ConclusionOur simulation results are in line with human experimental data. Specifically, phonological cues seem not only to activate phonologically similar items within the phonological level. Moreover, phonological cues support higher-level processing during access of the mental lexicon. Thus, the neural model introduced in this paper offers a promising approach to modeling the mental lexicon, and to incorporating the mental lexicon into a complex model of language processing.},

	abstract = {This is a partial theory of thinking, combining  a number of classical and modern concepts  from psychology, linguistics, and AI. Whenever  one encounters a new situation (or makes a  substantial change in one's viewpoint) he  selects from memory a structure called a  frame, a remembered framework to be  adopted to fit reality by changing details as  necessary. A frame is a data-structure for  representing a stereotyped situation, like  being in a certain kind of living room, or going  to a child's birthday party. Attached to each  frame are several kinds of information. Some  of this information is about how to use the  frame. Some is about what one can expect to  happen next. Some is about what to do if  these expectations are not confirmed. The  "top levels" of a frame are fixed, and represent  things that are always true about the  supposed situation. The lower levels have  many "slots" that must be filled by specific  instances or data. Collections of related  frames are linked together into frame-systems. The effects of important actions are  mirrored by transformations between the  frames of a system. These are used to make  certain kinds of calculations economical, to  represent changes of emphasis and attention  and to account for effectiveness of "imagery".  In Vision, the different frames of a system  describe the scene from different viewpoints,  and the transformations between one frame  and another represent the effects of moving  from place to place. Other kinds of frame-systems can represent actions, cause-effect  relations, or changes in conceptual viewpoint.  The paper applies the frame-system idea  also to problems of linguistic understanding:  memory, acquisition and retrieval of  knowledge, and a variety of ways to reason by  analogy and jump to conclusions based on  partial similarity matching.},

On the one hand, ontology-oriented languages allow us to describe symbolic structured knowledge and perform logical inference using entailment rules. To what extent this could provide a rather natural representation of usual human reasoning is an open question, that we are going to discuss here, considering a generalization to modal logic, and also beyond deductive reasoning, discussing whether this could also apply to inductive and abductive reasoning.
On the other hand, spiking neuronal networks are biologically plausible implementations of brain circuit computations, which can provide a way to manipulate symbols embedded as numeric vectors that carry semantic information. In the present work, we consider such an architecture with the Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) formalism allowing us to describe neuronal implementations at an algebraic level.
This development illustrates how the former cognitive mechanisms can naturally emerge from usual distributed calculus, yielding neuro-symbolic computations. Our argument is to show that it can be implemented, considering a VSA approach, into biological neuronal computations. Such neuro-symbolic deductive mechanisms are especially useful in complex problem-solving.},

	abstract = {Nous proposons de manipuler des structures de données symboliques au sein d’algorithmes d'apprentissage automatique habituels, par exemple en considérant un système réactif engagé dans une tâche de résolution de problèmes ouverte et mal définie. Nous définissons les tâches de résolution de problèmes à un niveau géométrique, en considérant que nous sommes situés quelque part dans un espace d'états, dans le but d'atteindre un état final (unique ou alternatif, éventuellement partiellement défini), et de trouver un chemin du premier au dernier tout en respectant les contraintes du chemin. L'idée centrale de cette définition géométrique est de considérer un espace d'état abstrait où chaque point est une structure de données symboliques, représentant des informations contextuelles sur l'espace physique et sur l'état interne de l'agent. Sélectionner une trajectoire locale correspond à décider, comme étape du processus de résolution du problème, de modifier certaines caractéristiques de l'espace d'états tant au niveau externe (e.g., déplacer un objet) qu'au niveau interne (i.e., modifier la représentation interne). L'ingrédient principal est de spécifier une distance. Le levier est une notion de distance d'édition, c'est-à-dire le fait qu'une valeur de donnée symbolique est éditée pas à pas pour égaler une autre valeur. De plus, étant donné un type de données, cette spécification inclut la projection d'une valeur de données au voisinage de la région spécifiant un type de données sur celui-ci, comme développé ici. Ce rapport introduit ces notions plutôt abstraites en les rendant les plus accessibles possibles, notamment en montrant leur relation avec la modélisation en neuroscience computationnelle et en les illustrant à l'aide d'un exemple de dessins et d'un exemple musical.},

We then relate this representation to the probability theory, based on the assumption that necessity and possibility provide bounds for probability values, and finally discuss how to define a relevant projection of real values onto an admissible representation.

	abstract = {Some human cognitive tasks may involve tightly interleaved logical and numerical computations. On the one hand, ontologies allow us to describe symbolic structured knowledge and perform logical inference, providing a rather natural representation of human reasoning as modeled in cognitive psychology. On the other hand, spiking neural networks are a biologically plausible implementation of processing in brain circuits, yet they process numeric vectors rather than symbolic data. Unifying these symbolic and sub-symbolic approaches is still a wide and open question, and the Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA) based on the Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) provides a way to manipulate symbols embedded as numeric vectors that carry semantic information.
In this paper, as a step towards filling the symbolic/numerical gap, we propose to map an ontology onto a SPA-based architecture with a preliminary partial implementation into spiking neural networks. More specifically, we focus on ontology standards used in the semantic web such as Resource Description Framework [Schema] (RDF[S]) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL). We provide a detailed implementation example in the case of specific RDFS entailments based on predicate chaining. To that end, we used the neural simulator Nengo with two associative memories in interaction, the first one storing assertions and the second one storing entailment rules. Reporting interesting formal results, our embedding enjoys intrinsic properties allowing semantic reasoning through distributed numerical computing. This original preliminary work thus combines symbolic and numerical approaches for cognitive modeling, which might be useful to model some complex human tasks such as ill-defined problem-solving, involving neuronal knowledge manipulation.},

Unifying these symbolic and sub-symbolic approaches is still a wide and open question, and the Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA) based on the Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) provides a way to manipulate symbols embedded as numeric vectors that carry semantic information.},

It has shown great promise in a variety of domains, but it often struggles with generalization and interpretability due to its reliance on black-box models. One approach to address this issue is to incorporate knowledge representation into reinforcement learning. In this work, we explore the benefits of using symbolic representation in reinforcement learning and present preliminary results on its performance compared to standard reinforcement learning techniques. Our experiments show that the use of symbolic representation can significantly improve the generalization capabilities of reinforcement learning agents. We also discuss the potential challenges and limitations of this approach and suggest avenues for future research.},

L'enjeu est ici de travailler à partir d'un relativement petit lot de données (quelques dizaines à comparer aux milliers de données utilisées avec les méthodes statistiques classiques), fortement structurées, donc d'introduire un maximum d'informations a priori en amont de l'analyse pour permettre que les résultats soient significatifs. L'apprenant·e est modélisé·e à partir de connaissances issues des sciences de l'éducation et des neurosciences cognitives, y compris les formalismes d'apprentissage machine, dans le cadre très précis d'une tâche -dite « CreaCube »- d'initiation à la pensée informatique, présentée sous forme d'un problème ouvert, qui implique la résolution d'un problème et de faire appel à la créativité. Ce document présente ces éléments et discute les problématiques d'exploration et exploitation, les différents buts (par exemple de performance, de célérité ou de maîtrise de la tâche), avant de relier cela aux différents types de mémoire et de discuter les bases de la résolution de problèmes, et l'engagement dans une activité d'apprentissage. Il décrit ensuite la construction très précise d'une ontologie qui formalise ce processus de résolution de tâche et de construction de connaissances, prenant en compte les stimuli reçus, la découverte d'affordances, la pose d'hypothèses, bien distinguées de la notion de croyance, sans oublier les connaissances contextuelles. La production est mise en partage sous forme de ressource libre et ouverte, et on discute en conclusion à la fois les implications et les perspectives de ce travail pionnier de formalisation d'une telle tâche d'apprentissage humain.

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning is generally accepted to be an appropriate and successful method to learn robot control. Symbolic action planning is useful to resolve causal dependencies and to break a causally complex problem down into a sequence of simpler high-level actions. A problem with the integration of both approaches is that action planning is based on discrete high-level action- and state spaces, whereas reinforcement learning is usually driven by a continuous reward function. Recent advances in model-free reinforcement learning, speciﬁcally, universal value function approximators and hindsight experience replay, have focused on goal-independent methods based on sparse rewards that are only given at the end of a rollout, and only if the goal has been fully achieved. In this article, we build on these novel methods to facilitate the integration of action planning with model-free reinforcement learning. Speciﬁcally, the paper demonstrates how the reward-sparsity can serve as a bridge between the high-level and low-level state- and action spaces. As a result, we demonstrate that the integrated method is able to solve robotic tasks that involve non-trivial causal dependencies under noisy conditions, exploiting both data and knowledge.},

The core function of cognitive control is to arbitrate between staying with the current behavioural strategy, and adjusting it through reinforcement learning (RL)-versus retrieving previously learned strategies or exploring new ones. The arbitration primary requires inferring when the current state of the environment changes, thereby reflecting the occurrence of previously encountered situations or new ones. The middle lateral PFC (LPFC) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) along with the more posterior prefrontal regions are involved in switching between task sets. The dACC is densely and reciprocally connected to the adjacent medial PFC regions and especially to the middle LPFC regions. Human neuroimaging studies provide evidence that the caudal LPFC in the front of the premotor cortex forms hierarchical selective models within task sets, that is, when external contingencies are inferred as being stable.},

The study capitalizes upon previous affordance propositions and frameworks in order to establish an affordance-based framework in the scope of playful educational robotics contexts, through the adoption of a qualitative research methodology, which was considered more appropriate as an exploratory tool. As part of the qualitative analysis, the study is mapping different types of affordances, related to such technologies, as well as an iterative creative problem-solving process that stems from learners’ interactions with robotic artifacts, like the CreaCube playful robotics activity, which is presented in this study.},

	abstract = {Creativity is a complex human process evaluated through psychometric tasks, mostly in relation to divergent thinking (DT) or the capacity to generate new ideas. In social robotics, creativity has been supported in different interactions with social robots, in which the Human Robot Interaction (HRI) supports the participants’ creativity. However, as scores are typically used for such evaluations, they struggle to capture the inherent creative process involved in a task. In this paper, we focus on creative problem solving in Human Robot Interaction considering the edit distance by analyzing the evolution of the different configurations of a set of modular robotic cubes during the task resolution. For this objective, we consider the three DT components of fluidity, flexibility, and innovation as evaluated in the Alternate Use Test task. We then operationalize the edit distance (ED), usually used for quantifying the minimum number of operations required to transform one configuration into another. ED is a way to compute the differences between two intermediate creative solutions. We engaged 224 participants in playing the CreaCube task, and then we analyzed the videos for identifying in time each of the configurations. The results allow us to maintain the hypothesis related to the DT components in relation to ED and discuss the implications of this study in social robotics.},

	abstract = {The term heuristic appears many times in the literatures on reasoning and decision making. For example, we have the heuristic-analytic theory (Evans, 1989), the probability heuristics model (Chater \& Oaksford, 1999), judgment heuristics (Kahneman, Slovic, \& Tversky, 1982) and simple heuristics that make us smart (Gigerenzer \& Todd, 1999). What these theories have in common is that they suggest that people make inferences by using processes that are relatively simple to apply. Hence, people are able to make reasonably speedy and accurate decisions without recourse to lengthy and possibly computationally intractable procedures. Thus, they can avoid the need to form comprehensive and detailed representations of the world and/or consider many alternative possibilities. However, implicit in the use of the word heuristic is that it is possible to identify processes that are not heuristics, and that these have actually been proposed as models of human reasoning. However, in this chapter, I will argue that a distinction between heuristic versus nonheuristic processes is not necessarily psychologically appropriate, as the term heuristic implies an inherent degree of inaccuracy, thus ruling out similarly simple procedures that also save time and effort, but instead lead to accurate answers. Heuristics will therefore be considered as part of a wider category of short-cut procedures. Their purpose is to reduce processing load, and their use and development will be considered with respect to deductive reasoning. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {The ability to conduct logical reasoning is a fundamental aspect of intelligent human behavior, and thus an important problem along the way to human-level artificial intelligence. Traditionally, logic-based symbolic methods from the field of knowledge representation and reasoning have been used to equip agents with capabilities that resemble human logical reasoning qualities. More recently, however, there has been an increasing interest in using machine learning rather than logic-based symbolic formalisms to tackle these tasks. In this paper, we employ state-of-the-art methods for training deep neural networks to devise a novel model that is able to learn how to effectively perform logical reasoning in the form of basic ontology reasoning. This is an important and at the same time very natural logical reasoning task, which is why the presented approach is applicable to a plethora of important real-world problems. We present the outcomes of several experiments, which show that our model is able to learn to perform highly accurate ontology reasoning on very large, diverse, and challenging benchmarks. Furthermore, it turned out that the suggested approach suffers much less from different obstacles that prohibit logic-based symbolic reasoning, and, at the same time, is surprisingly plausible from a biological point of view.},

	abstract = {We present a unified computational theory of an agent's perception and memory. In our model, perception, episodic memory, and semantic memory are realized by different operational modes of the oscillating interactions between a symbolic index layer and a subsymbolic representation layer. The two layers form a bilayer tensor network (BTN). Although memory appears to be about the past, its main purpose is to support the agent in the present and the future. Recent episodic memory provides the agent with a sense of the here and now. Remote episodic memory retrieves relevant past experiences to provide information about possible future scenarios. This aids the agent in decision-making. "Future" episodic memory, based on expected future events, guides planning and action. Semantic memory retrieves specific information, which is not delivered by current perception, and defines priors for future observations. We argue that it is important for the agent to encode individual entities, not just classes and attributes. We demonstrate that a form of self-supervised learning can acquire new concepts and refine existing ones. We test our model on a standard benchmark data set, which we expanded to contain richer representations for attributes, classes, and individuals. Our key hypothesis is that obtaining a better understanding of perception and memory is a crucial prerequisite to comprehending human-level intelligence.},

	abstract = {Lateralized brain regions subserve functions such as language and visuospatial processing. It has been conjectured that individuals may be left-brain dominant or right-brain dominant based on personality and cognitive style, but neuroimaging data has not provided clear evidence whether such phenotypic differences in the strength of left-dominant or right-dominant networks exist. We evaluated whether strongly lateralized connections covaried within the same individuals. Data were analyzed from publicly available resting state scans for 1011 individuals between the ages of 7 and 29. For each subject, functional lateralization was measured for each pair of 7266 regions covering the gray matter at 5-mm resolution as a difference in correlation before and after inverting images across the midsagittal plane. The difference in gray matter density between homotopic coordinates was used as a regressor to reduce the effect of structural asymmetries on functional lateralization. Nine left- and 11 right-lateralized hubs were identified as peaks in the degree map from the graph of significantly lateralized connections. The left-lateralized hubs included regions from the default mode network (medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and temporoparietal junction) and language regions (e.g., Broca Area and Wernicke Area), whereas the right-lateralized hubs included regions from the attention control network (e.g., lateral intraparietal sulcus, anterior insula, area MT, and frontal eye fields). Left- and right-lateralized hubs formed two separable networks of mutually lateralized regions. Connections involving only left- or only right-lateralized hubs showed positive correlation across subjects, but only for connections sharing a node. Lateralization of brain connections appears to be a local rather than global property of brain networks, and our data are not consistent with a whole-brain phenotype of greater "left-brained" or greater "right-brained" network strength across individuals. Small increases in lateralization with age were seen, but no differences in gender were observed.},

Others continue to argue in favor, but the case has not been demonstrated in any formal way. The present paper sets out a framework in which the value of representation use can be mathematically measured, albeit in a broadly sensory context rather than a specifically cognitive one. Key to the approach is the use of Bayesian networks for modeling the distal dimension of sensory processes. More relevant to cognitive science is the theoretical result obtained, which is that a certain type of representational architecture is necessary for achievement of sensory efficiency. While exhibiting few of the characteristics of traditional, symbolic encoding, this architecture corresponds quite closely to the forms of embedded representation now being explored in some embedded/embodied approaches. It becomes meaningful to view that type of representation use as a form of information recovery. A formal basis then exists for viewing representation not so much as the substrate of reasoning and thought, but rather as a general medium for efficient, interpretive processing.},

However, most have shown weak to no effects. Thus, it is important to examine how growth mindset might affect retention and transfer of learning, as well as process-related variables such as cognitive load. In a double-blind, randomized controlled experiment based on 138 secondary school students, the effects of an experimentally induced growth mindset belief were examined during a learning phase in a classroom setting. Participants in the growth mindset condition perceived a lower intrinsic load and extraneous load and performed better on retention and transfer tests. Students with some prior knowledge also reported a higher mastery goal orientation. Supplementary mediation analysis suggested that the effect on transfer could be fully accounted for by changes in cognitive load perceptions.

Current versions of the theory use evolutionary educational psychology to categorise the information that humans process and to provide a template for human cognitive architecture that is analogous to the information processes of evolutionary biology.

The theoretical base and its attendant instructional effects provide information on the characteristics and role of human problem solving in instructional design. It is concluded that teachable aspects of skilled problem solving are domain-specific rather than generic-cognitive in nature, and that those characteristics should determine what is taught and how it is taught. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Helen Askell-Williams and Janice Orrell; individual chapters, the contributors.},

Evolutionary psychology is used to assume that knowledge should be divided into biologically primary information that we have specifically evolved to acquire and biologically secondary information that we have not specifically evolved to acquire. Primary knowledge frequently consists of generic-cognitive skills that are important to human survival and cannot be taught because they are acquired unconsciously while secondary knowledge is usually domain-specific in nature and requires explicit instruction in education and training contexts. Secondary knowledge is first processed by a limited capacity, limited duration working memory before being permanently stored in long-term memory from where unlimited amounts of information can be transferred back to working memory to govern action appropriate for the environment. The theory uses this cognitive architecture to design instructional procedures largely relevant to complex information that requires a reduction in working memory load. Many of those instructional procedures can be most readily used with the assistance of educational technology.},

Cluster analysis of the problem-solving tasks indicated that the presumed insight problems did tend to cluster with other presumed insight problems, and similarly the presumed non-insight problems tended to cluster with other presumed non-insight tasks. Performance on presumed insight problems was particularly linked to measures of ideational flexibility with a different pattern of results for the non-insight tasks. Spatial insight problems were linked to spatial flexibility and verbal insight tasks were linked to vocabulary scores.

	abstract = {This study utilized a task-specific, structured interview (microanalysis) to examine self-regulated learning (SRL; e.g., self-efficacy, strategic planning, strategy use, and self-evaluation) while students engaged in a creative problem-solving task. Participants included 58 fifth and sixth graders. Regressions examined the variance explained by SRL processes in relation to four creative performance outcomes including fluency (i.e., number of solutions generated), flexibility (i.e., number of categories of solutions generated), originality (i.e., uniqueness of the answer), and usefulness (i.e., quality of response). Results indicated that specific SRL variables are differentially related to creative outcomes. After controlling for prior performance on a standardized language test, self-efficacy significantly predicted fluency and flexibility. Regarding the strategic planning measures, plans regarding how to complete the task predicted fluency and flexibility, whereas plans of how to address a challenge predicted fluency and originality. A measure of self-evaluation accuracy significantly explained the usefulness of ideas, but was significantly, negatively related to originality. Although strategy use significantly correlated to fluency and flexibility, it did not explain a significant amount of unique variance in these creative outcomes.

When dictionaries are analyzed as directed graphs with links from defining words to defined words, they reveal a latent structure. Recursively removing all words that are reachable by definition but that do not define any further words reduces the dictionary to a Kernel of about 10\% of its size. This is still not the smallest number of words that can define all the rest. About 75\% of the Kernel turns out to be its Core, a “Strongly Connected Subset” of words with a definitional path to and from any pair of its words and no word's definition depending on a word outside the set. But the Core cannot define all the rest of the dictionary. The 25\% of the Kernel surrounding the Core consists of small strongly connected subsets of words: the Satellites. The size of the smallest set of words that can define all the rest—the graph's “minimum feedback vertex set” or MinSet—is about 1\% of the dictionary, about 15\% of the Kernel, and part-Core/part-Satellite. But every dictionary has a huge number of MinSets. The Core words are learned earlier, more frequent, and less concrete than the Satellites, which are in turn learned earlier, more frequent, but more concrete than the rest of the Dictionary. In principle, only one MinSet's words would need to be grounded through the sensorimotor capacity to recognize and categorize their referents. In a dual-code sensorimotor/symbolic model of the mental lexicon, the symbolic code could do all the rest through recombinatory definition.},

This has even driven some of us to conclude that ChatGPT actually understands. It’s not true that it understands. But it is also not true that we understand how it can do what it can do. I will suggest some hunches about benign “biases”:  convergent constraints that emerge at LLM-scale that may be helping ChatGPT do so much better than we would have expected. These biases are inherent in the nature of language itself, at LLM-scale, and they are closely linked to what it is that ChatGPT lacks, which is direct sensorimotor grounding to connect its words to their referents and its propositions to their meanings. These convergent biases are related to (1) the parasitism of indirect verbal grounding on direct sensorimotor grounding, (2) the circularity of verbal definition, (3) the “mirroring” of language production and comprehension, (4) iconicity in propositions at LLM-scale, (5) computational counterparts of human “categorical perception” in category learning by neural nets, and perhaps also (6) a conjecture by Chomsky about the laws of thought.

Core to the framework is a self-discovery process where LLMs select multiple atomic reasoning modules such as critical thinking and step-by-step thinking, and compose them into an explicit reasoning structure for LLMs to follow during decoding. SELF-DISCOVER substantially improves GPT-4 and PaLM 2's performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks such as BigBench-Hard, grounded agent reasoning, and MATH, by as much as 32\% compared to Chain of Thought (CoT). Furthermore, SELF-DISCOVER outperforms inference-intensive methods such as CoT-Self-Consistency by more than 20\%, while requiring 10-40x fewer inference compute. Finally, we show that the self-discovered reasoning structures are universally applicable across model families: from PaLM 2-L to GPT-4, and from GPT-4 to Llama2, and share commonalities with human reasoning patterns.},

We discuss behavioral and neuronal findings from three areas that reflect strong connections between ASC and the underlying effects on metacontrol on the one hand and components of creativity on the other hand: drug-induced ASC, meditation-induced ASC, and hallucinations. While more, and especially more systematic research is needed, we identify a general trend, suggesting that factors that induce ASC are likely to alter the metacontrol state by biasing it toward either persistence, which is beneficial for convergent thinking and other persistence-heavy operations, or flexibility, which is beneficial for divergent thinking and other flexibility-heavy operations.},

	abstract = {This article provides the first survey of computational models of emotion in reinforcement learning (RL) agents. The survey focuses on agent/robot emotions, and mostly ignores human user emotions. Emotions are recognized as functional in decision-making by influencing motivation and action selection. Therefore, computational emotion models are usually grounded in the agent's decision making architecture, of which RL is an important subclass. Studying emotions in RL-based agents is useful for three research fields. For machine learning (ML) researchers, emotion models may improve learning efficiency. For the interactive ML and human-robot interaction (HRI) community, emotions can communicate state and enhance user investment. Lastly, it allows affective modelling (AM) researchers to investigate their emotion theories in a successful AI agent class. This survey provides background on emotion theory and RL. It systematically addresses 1) from what underlying dimensions (e.g., homeostasis, appraisal) emotions can be derived and how these can be modelled in RL-agents, 2) what types of emotions have been derived from these dimensions, and 3) how these emotions may either influence the learning efficiency of the agent or be useful as social signals. We also systematically compare evaluation criteria, and draw connections to important RL sub-domains like (intrinsic) motivation and model-based RL. In short, this survey provides both a practical overview for engineers wanting to implement emotions in their RL agents, and identifies challenges and directions for future emotion-RL research.},

More precisely, to interpret a text, one must prove the logical form of the text from what is already mutually known, allowing for coercions, merging redundancies where possible, and making assumptions where necessary. It is shown how such “local pragmatics” problems as reference resolution, the interpretation of compound nominals, the resolution of syntactic ambiguity and metonymy, and schema recognition can be solved in this manner. Moreover, this approach of “interpretation as abduction” can be combined with the older view of “parsing as deduction” to produce an elegant and thorough integration of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics, one that spans the range of linguistic phenomena from phonology to discourse structure. Finally, we discuss means for making the abduction process efficient, possibilities for extending the approach to other pragmatics phenomena, and the semantics of the weights and costs in the abduction scheme.},

Explanations must be sufficient to induce belief in the sentence to be explained (for instance, some observation), or ensure its consistency with other beliefs, in a manner that adequately accounts for factual and hypothetical sentences. Our model will generate explanations that nonmonotonically predict an observation, thus generalizing most current accounts, which require some deductive relationship between explanation and observation. It also provides a natural preference ordering on explanations, defined in terms of normality or plausibility. To illustrate the generality of our approach, we reconstruct two of the key paradigms for model-based diagnosis, abductive and consistency-based diagnosis, within our framework. This reconstruction provides an alternative semantics for both and extends these systems to accommodate our predictive explanations and semantic preferences on explanations. It also illustrates how more general information can be incorporated in a principled manner.},

This work applies the same methodology to face modal abduction. The non-classical context enforces the value of analytical proof systems as tools to face the meta-logical and proof-theoretical questions involved in abductive reasoning.The similarities and differences between quantifiers and modal operators are investigated and proof theoretical abduction methods for the modal systems K, D, T and S4 are defined, that are sound and complete. The construction of the abductive explanations is in strict relation with the expansion rules for the modal logics, in a modular manner that makes local modifications possible. The method given in this paper is general, in the sense that it can be adapted to any propositional modal logic for which analytic tableaux are provided. Moreover, the way towards an extension to first order modal logic is straightforward.},

	abstract = {According to Bayesian theories in psychology and neuroscience, minds and brains are (near) optimal in solving a wide range of tasks. We challenge this view and argue that more traditional, non-Bayesian approaches are more promising. We make 3 main arguments. First, we show that the empirical evidence for Bayesian theories in psychology is weak. This weakness relates to the many arbitrary ways that priors, likelihoods, and utility functions can be altered in order to account for the data that are obtained, making the models unfalsifiable. It further relates to the fact that Bayesian theories are rarely better at predicting data compared with alternative (and simpler) non-Bayesian theories. Second, we show that the empirical evidence for Bayesian theories in neuroscience is weaker still. There are impressive mathematical analyses showing how populations of neurons could compute in a Bayesian manner but little or no evidence that they do. Third, we challenge the general scientific approach that characterizes Bayesian theorizing in cognitive science. A common premise is that theories in psychology should largely be constrained by a rational analysis of what the mind ought to do. We question this claim and argue that many of the important constraints come from biological, evolutionary, and processing (algorithmic) considerations that have no adaptive relevance to the problem per se. In our view, these factors have contributed to the development of many Bayesian “just so” stories in psychology and neuroscience; that is, mathematical analyses of cognition that can be used to explain almost any behavior as optimal.

La question du fonctionnement de l’esprit est au cœur des sciences cognitives. Ces dernières visent à comprendre et à expliquer les processus complexes sous-tendant la perception, la prise de décision et l’apprentissage, trois domaines fondamentaux de la cognition. La théorie du cerveau bayésien, une approche computationnelle issue des principes du traitement prédictif (PP, Predictive Processing), propose une formulation mécanistique et mathématique de ces processus cognitifs. Cette théorie suppose que le cerveau encode des croyances (états probabilistes) pour générer des prédictions à propos des entrées sensorielles, puis utilise les erreurs de prédictions pour mettre à jour ses croyances. Dans cet article, nous présentons une introduction aux principes fondamentaux de la théorie du cerveau bayésien. Nous montrons comment cette théorie innovante hybride des concepts hérités de la philosophie de l’esprit et les données expérimentales issues des neurosciences, et comment elle traduit des processus cognitifs complexes comme la perception, l’action, l’émotion, et la croyance, ou encore la symptomatologie psychiatrique.
The question of how the mind works is at the heart of cognitive science. It aims to understand and explain the complex processes underlying perception, decision-making and learning, three fundamental areas of cognition. Bayesian Brain Theory, a computational approach derived from the principles of Predictive Processing (PP), offers a mechanistic and mathematical formulation of these cognitive processes. This theory assumes that the brain encodes beliefs (probabilistic states) to generate predictions about sensory input, then uses prediction errors to update its beliefs. In this paper, we present an introduction to the fundamentals of Bayesian Brain Theory. We show how this innovative theory hybridizes concepts inherited from the philosophy of mind and experimental data from neuroscience, and how it translates complex cognitive processes such as perception, action, emotion, or belief, or even the psychiatric symptomatology.},

A recent surge of interest into the neural underpinnings of creative behavior has produced a banquet of data that is tantalizing but, considered as a whole, deeply self-contradictory. We review the emerging literature and take stock of several long-standing theories and widely held beliefs about creativity. A total of 72 experiments, reported in 63 articles, make up the core of the review. They broadly fall into 3 categories: divergent thinking, artistic creativity, and insight. Electroencephalographic studies of divergent thinking yield highly variegated results. Neuroimaging studies of this paradigm also indicate no reliable changes above and beyond diffuse prefrontal activation. These findings call into question the usefulness of the divergent thinking construct in the search for the neural basis of creativity. A similarly inconclusive picture emerges for studies of artistic performance, except that this paradigm also often yields activation of motor and temporoparietal regions. Neuroelectric and imaging studies of insight are more consistent, reflecting changes in anterior cingulate cortex and prefrontal areas. Taken together, creative thinking does not appear to critically depend on any single mental process or brain region, and it is not especially associated with right brains, defocused attention, low arousal, or alpha synchronization, as sometimes hypothesized. To make creativity tractable in the brain, it must be further subdivided into different types that can be meaningfully associated with specific neurocognitive processes.},

Emphasis is put on the importance of limited computational resources for online prediction and compression. Discrete and continuous time formulations are given.

For these reasons, the present study recruited 390 participants to complete online questionnaires on scientific motivation, creative process engagement, and scientific creativity. Correlation Network Analysis and Bayesian Network Analysis were employed to get an integrated model for studying the interactive effects among the factors. Bootstrap analysis was used to determine the critical path between these factors. Results showed that: (1) Intrinsic-related scientific motivation played critical roles in the regularized partial correlation network involving scientific motivation, creative process engagement, and scientific creativity. Further, more sparsity was revealed in the partial cor­ relation network of males, but the scientific creativity of males is more strongly linked with other nodes in the network. (2) Career motivation was the parent node for the Bayesian Network and would positively impact scientific creativity by transforming it into intrinsic-related scientific motivation. In addition, idea generation and intrinsic motivation directly drive scientific creativity. The parent nodes of male and female Bayesian net­ works are different, but IMPR plays a central role in males and females. (3) The bootstrap path analysis further verified pathways revealed by the Bayesian Network, as extrinsic-related motivation influenced scientific crea­ tivity through intrinsic motivation and creative process engagement. These findings demonstrate that intrinsicrelated scientific motivations are the critical factor for promoting scientific creativity and that females and males show different network characteristics.},

Deep neural networks trained on object classification tasks are a natural testbed for the applicability of this relation. We show how classification capacity improves along the hierarchies of deep neural networks with different architectures. We demonstrate that changes in the geometry of the associated object manifolds underlie this improved capacity, and shed light on the functional roles different levels in the hierarchy play to achieve it, through orchestrated reduction of manifolds’ radius, dimensionality and inter-manifold correlations.},

At the core of this question lie considerations about how neural circuits can perform computations that enable sensory perception, decision making, and motor control. It is thought that such computations are implemented through the dynamical evolution of distributed activity in recurrent circuits. Thus, identifying dynamical structure in neural population activity is a key challenge towards a better understanding of neural computation. At the same time, interpreting this structure in light of the computation of interest is essential for linking the time-varying activity patterns of the neural population to ongoing computational processes. Here, we review methods that aim to quantify structure in neural population recordings through a dynamical system defined in a low-dimensional latent variable space. We discuss advantages and limitations of different modelling approaches and address future challenges for the field.},

One approach seeks to identify neural circuit elements that carry out specific functions, emphasizing connectivity between neurons as a substrate for neural computations. Another approach centres on neural manifolds — low-dimensional representations of behavioural signals in neural population activity — and suggests that neural computations are realized by emergent dynamics. Although manifolds reveal an interpretable structure in heterogeneous neuronal activity, finding the corresponding structure in connectivity remains a challenge. We highlight examples in which establishing the correspondence between low-dimensional activity and connectivity has been possible, unifying the neural manifold and circuit perspectives. This relationship is conspicuous in systems in which the geometry of neural responses mirrors their spatial layout in the brain, such as the fly navigational system. Furthermore, we describe evidence that, in systems in which neural responses are heterogeneous, the circuit comprises interactions between activity patterns on the manifold via low-rank connectivity. We suggest that unifying the manifold and circuit approaches is important if we are to be able to causally test theories about the neural computations that underlie behaviour.},

	abstract = {AI-powered learning technologies are increasingly being used to automate and scaffold learning activities (e.g., personalised reminders for completing tasks, automated real-time feedback for improving writing, or recommendations for when and what to study). While the prevailing view is that these technologies generally have a positive effect on student learning, their impact on students’ agency and ability to self-regulate their learning is under-explored. Do students learn from the regular, detailed and personalised feedback provided by AI systems, and will they continue to exhibit similar behaviour in the absence of assistance? Or do they instead continue to rely on AI assistance without learning from it? To contribute to filling this research gap, we conducted a randomised controlled experiment that explored the impact of AI assistance on student agency in the context of peer feedback. With 1625 students across 10 courses, an experiment was conducted using peer review. During the initial four-week period, students were guided by AI features that utilised techniques such as rule-based suggestion detection, semantic similarity, and comparison with previous comments made by the reviewer to enhance their submissions if the feedback provided was deemed insufficiently detailed or general in nature. Over the following four weeks, students were divided into four different groups: control (AI) received prompts, (NR) received no prompts, (SR) received self-monitoring checklists in place of AI prompts, and (SAI) had access to both AI prompts and self-monitoring checklists. Results of the experiment suggest that students tended to rely on rather than learn from AI assistance. If AI assistance was removed, self-regulated strategies could help fill the gap but were not as effective as AI assistance. Results also showed that hybrid human-AI approaches that complement AI assistance with self-regulated strategies (SAI) were not more effective than AI assistance on its own. We conclude by discussing the broader benefits, challenges and implications of relying on AI assistance in relation to student agency in a world where we learn, live and work with AI.},

Many strong claims are made about the successes and the promise of this new discipline. By contrast, I show that there are no current examples of neuroscience motivating new and effective teaching methods, and argue that neuroscience is unlikely to improve teaching in the future. The reasons are twofold. First, in practice, it is easier to characterize the cognitive capacities of children on the basis of behavioral measures than on the basis of brain measures. As a consequence, neuroscience rarely offers insights into instruction above and beyond psychology. Second, in principle, the theoretical motivations underpinning educational neuroscience are misguided, and this makes it difficult to design or assess new teaching methods on the basis of neuroscience. Regarding the design of instruction, it is widely assumed that remedial instruction should target the underlying deficits associated with learning disorders, and neuroscience is used to characterize the deficit. However, the most effective forms of instruction may often rely on developing compensatory (nonimpaired) skills. Neuroscience cannot determine whether instruction should target impaired or nonimpaired skills. More importantly, regarding the assessment of instruction, the only relevant issue is whether the child learns, as reflected in behavior. Evidence that the brain changed in response to instruction is irrelevant. At the same time, an important goal for neuroscience is to characterize how the brain changes in response to learning, and this includes learning in the classroom. Neuroscientists cannot help educators, but educators can help neuroscientists. (PsycINFO Database Record},

The authors have also failed to address the reasons why EN is unlikely to benefit educational outcomes in the future. Psychology, by contrast, can (and has) made important discoveries that can (and should) be used to improve teaching and diagnostic tests for learning difficulties.

Previous surveys showed that this is true for scientific issues. It follows that the newspaper coverage of scientific issues should appear as politically oriented, as observed regarding climate change. Here, we tested this prediction regarding educational neuroscience. This scientific issue is interesting because it implies no major economic interest and because the relevance of neuroscience regarding teaching in the classroom is still highly controversial. As hypothesized, we observed that the French press appeared strongly polarized: the right-leaning press was mostly favorable to educational neuroscience, whereas critical opinions were mainly found in the social-democrat press. Although the relevance of neuroscience toward teaching was rarely discussed in scientific arguments, political actors often invoked educational neuroscience in the press to legitimate their decision.},

Here, we suggest that translation cannot be understood as a single process: rather, we demonstrate that at least four different ‘bridges’ can conceivably be built between these two fields. Following this, we demonstrate that, far from being a matter of information lack, a prescriptive neuroscience/education bridge (the one most relevant to Bruer’s argument) is a practical and philosophical impossibility due to incommensurability between non-adjacent compositional levels-of-organization: a limitation inherent in all sciences. After defining this concept in the context of biology, we apply this concept to the learning sciences and demonstrate why all brain research must be behaviorally translated before prescriptive educational applicability can be elucidated. We conclude by exploring examples of how explicating different forms of translation and adopting a levels-of-organization framework can be used to contextualize and beneficially guide research and practice across all learning sciences.},

	abstract = {Machine learning models exhibit strong performance on datasets with abundant labeled samples. However, for tabular datasets with extremely high \$d\$-dimensional features but limited \$n\$ samples (i.e. \$d {\textbackslash}gg n\$), machine learning models struggle to achieve strong performance due to the risk of overfitting. Here, our key insight is that there is often abundant, auxiliary domain information describing input features which can be structured as a heterogeneous knowledge graph (KG). We propose PLATO, a method that achieves strong performance on tabular data with \$d {\textbackslash}gg n\$ by using an auxiliary KG describing input features to regularize a multilayer perceptron (MLP). In PLATO, each input feature corresponds to a node in the auxiliary KG. In the MLP’s first layer, each input feature also corresponds to a weight vector. PLATO is based on the inductive bias that two input features corresponding to similar nodes in the auxiliary KG should have similar weight vectors in the MLP's first layer. PLATO captures this inductive bias by inferring the weight vector for each input feature from its corresponding node in the KG via a trainable message-passing function. Across 6 \$d {\textbackslash}gg n\$ datasets, PLATO outperforms 13 state-of-the-art baselines by up to 10.19\%.},

	abstract = {The problem of extending a function f defined on a training data C on an unknown manifold X to the entire manifold and a tubular neighborhood of this manifold is considered in this paper. For X embedded in a high dimensional ambient Euclidean space R(D), a deep learning algorithm is developed for finding a local coordinate system for the manifold without eigen--decomposition, which reduces the problem to the classical problem of function approximation on a low dimensional cube. Deep nets (or multilayered neural networks) are proposed to accomplish this approximation scheme by using the training data. Our methods do not involve such optimization techniques as back--propagation, while assuring optimal (a priori) error bounds on the output in terms of the number of derivatives of the target function. In addition, these methods are universal, in that they do not require a prior knowledge of the smoothness of the target function, but adjust the accuracy of approximation locally and automatically, depending only upon the local smoothness of the target function. Our ideas are easily extended to solve both the pre--image problem and the out--of--sample extension problem, with a priori bounds on the growth of the function thus extended.},

We focus then on creative problem solving (CPS) tasks and review the current theoretical frameworks in relation to the regulation of creative problem solving as a process allowing to monitor the creative activity from the initial state of the task to one of the potential solution states. At the CPS level we consider the five main phases of Amabile : problem posing, preparing, idea generation, selecting ideas and developing an appropriate solution for the problem. These five phases should be regulated through the task to achieve a potential solution. In this study we analyze the limits of current CPS models and we propose to consider creative behavior regulation in CPS by combining Amabile's phases at the task level and we consider the importance of creative behavior regulation of creative strategies (exploration/exploitation) and phases (divergent/convergent).},

In the Tower of London test, a puzzle in which beads sliding on pegs must be moved to match a designated goal configuration, patients with lesioned prefrontal cortex show deficits in planning a goal-directed sequence of moves. We propose a neuronal network model of sequence planning that passes this test and, when lesioned, fails in a way that mimics prefrontal patients’ behavior. Our model comprises a descending planning system with hierarchically organized plan, operation, and gesture levels, and an ascending evaluative system that analyzes the problem and computes internal reward signals that index the correct/erroneous status of the plan. Multiple parallel pathways connecting the evaluative and planning systems amend the plan and adapt it to the current problem. The model illustrates how specialized hierarchically organized neuronal assemblies may collectively emulate central executive or supervisory functions of the human brain.},

As a cumulative knowledge base, many of SDT’s fundamental tenets have been repeatedly examined. We identified 60 meta-analyses that tested many of the propositions of SDT’s six mini-theories, other theory-based hypotheses, and SDT’s utility in applied domains. In this review, we examine what these meta-analyses establish, highlighting the support they lend to the validity of SDT’s motivational taxonomy and its hypotheses regarding the respective effects of basic psychological need satisfaction and frustration on well-being and ill-being. Meta-analytic evidence also strongly supports the relevance of SDT for organizations, health care, parenting, and education among other domains, with identifiable gaps in the meta-analytic literature. We conclude by discussing the importance of broad theory and the use of meta-analytic knowledge as scaffolding for further theory and research, albeit with its own methodological limitations.

	abstract = {We are interested in the autonomous acquisition of repertoires of skills. Language-conditioned reinforcement learning ( LC - RL ) approaches are great tools in this quest, as they allow to express abstract goals as sets of constraints on the states. However, most LC - RL agents are not autonomous and cannot learn without ex-ternal instructions and feedback. Besides, their direct language condition cannot account for the goal-directed behavior of pre-verbal infants and strongly limits the expression of behavioral diversity for a given language input. To resolve these issues, we propose a new conceptual approach to language-conditioned RL : the Language-Goal-Behavior architecture ( LGB ). LGB decouples skill learning and language grounding via an intermediate semantic representation of the world. To showcase the properties of LGB , we present a speciﬁc implementation called DECSTR . DECSTR is an intrinsically motivated learning agent endowed with an innate semantic representation describing spatial relations between physical objects. In a ﬁrst stage ( G → B ), it freely explores its environment and targets self-generated semantic conﬁgurations. In a second stage ( L → G ), it trains a language-conditioned goal generator to generate semantic goals that match the constraints expressed in language-based inputs. We showcase the additional properties of LGB w.r.t. both an end-to-end LC - RL approach and a similar approach leveraging non-semantic, continuous intermediate representations. Intermediate semantic representations help satisfy language commands in a diversity of ways, enable strategy switching after a failure and facilitate language grounding.},

	abstract = {Developmental machine learning studies how artificial agents can model the way children learn open-ended repertoires of skills. Such agents need to create and represent goals, select which ones to pursue and learn to achieve them. Recent approaches have considered goal spaces that were either fixed and hand-defined or learned using generative models of states. This limited agents to sample goals within the distribution of known effects. We argue that the ability to imagine out-of-distribution goals is key to enable creative discoveries and open-ended learning. Children do so by leveraging the compositionality of language as a tool to imagine descriptions of outcomes they never experienced before, targeting them as goals during play. We introduce IMAGINE, an intrinsically motivated deep reinforcement learning architecture that models this ability. Such imaginative agents, like children, benefit from the guidance of a social peer who provides language descriptions. To take advantage of goal imagination, agents must be able to leverage these descriptions to interpret their imagined out-of-distribution goals. This generalization is made possible by modularity: a decomposition between learned goal-achievement reward function and policy relying on deep sets, gated attention and object-centered representations. We introduce the Playground environment and study how this form of goal imagination improves generalization and exploration over agents lacking this capacity. In addition, we identify the properties of goal imagination that enable these results and study the impacts of modularity and social interactions.},

It is thought that setting a problem aside before giving it another try aids problem-solving. The underlying mechanisms of such an incubation period could include unconscious processing that fosters spreading activation along associated networks and the restructuring of problem representations. Recently, it has been suggested that sleep may also support problem-solving by supporting the transformation and restructuring of memory elements. Since the effect of sleep on problem-solving has been mainly tested using the Remote Associates Test, we chose three different tasks—classical riddles, visual change detection, and anagrams—to examine various aspects of problem-solving and to pinpoint task-specific prerequisites for effects of sleep or incubation to emerge. Sixty-two participants were given two attempts to solve the problems. Both attempts either occurred consecutively or were spaced apart by a 3-hour incubation interval that was spent awake or asleep. We found that a period of incubation positively affected solutions rates in classical riddles, but not in visual change detection or anagram solving. Contrary to our hypothesis, spending the incubation period asleep, did not yield any additional benefit. Our study thus supports the notion that a period of letting a problem rest is beneficial for its solution and confines the role of sleep to memory transformations that do not directly impact on problem-solving ability.},

	abstract = {Sleep consolidates memory for procedural motor skills, reflected by sleep-dependent changes in the hippocampal-striatal-cortical network. Other forms of procedural skills require the acquisition of a novel strategy to solve a problem, which recruit overlapping brain regions and specialized areas including the caudate and prefrontal cortex. Sleep preferentially benefits strategy and problem-solving skills over the accompanying motor execution movements. However, it is unclear how acquiring new strategies benefit from sleep. Here, participants performed a task requiring the execution of a sequence of movements to learn a novel cognitive strategy. Participants performed this task while undergoing fMRI before and after an interval of either a full night sleep, a daytime nap, or wakefulness. Participants also performed a motor control task, which precluded the opportunity to learn the strategy. In this way, we subtracted motor execution-related brain activations from activations specific to the strategy. The sleep and nap groups experienced greater behavioral performance improvements compared to the wake group on the strategy-based task. Following sleep, we observed enhanced activation of the caudate in addition to other regions in the hippocampal-striatal-cortical network, compared to wakefulness. This study demonstrates that sleep is a privileged time to enhance newly acquired cognitive strategies needed to solve problems.},

	abstract = {Many adolescents are experiencing a reduction in sleep as a consequence of a variety of behavioral factors (e.g., academic workload, social and employment opportunities), even though scientific evidence suggests that the biological need for sleep increases during maturation. Consequently, the ability to effectively interact with peers while learning and processing novel information may be diminished in many sleep-deprived adolescents. Furthermore, sleep deprivation may account for reductions in cognitive efficiency in many children and adolescents with special education needs. In response to recognition of this potential problem by parents, educators, and scientists, some school districts have implemented delayed bus schedules and school start times to allow for increased sleep duration for high school students, in an effort to increase academic performance and decrease behavioral problems. The long-term effects of this change are yet to be determined; however, preliminary studies suggest that the short-term impact on learning and behavior has been beneficial. Thus, many parents, teachers, and scientists are supporting further consideration of this information to formulate policies that may maximize learning and developmental opportunities for children. Although changing school start times may be an effective method to combat sleep deprivation in most adolescents, some adolescents experience sleep deprivation and consequent diminished daytime performance because of common underlying sleep disorders (e.g., asthma or sleep apnea). In such cases, surgical, pharmaceutical, or respiratory therapy, or a combination of the three, interventions are required to restore normal sleep and daytime performance.},

	abstract = {Previous research has shown that performance on problem solving improves over a period of sleep, as compared with wakefulness. However, these studies have not determined whether sleep is beneficial for problem solving or whether sleep merely mitigates against interference due to an interruption to solution attempts. Sleep-dependent improvements have been described in terms of spreading activation, which raises the prediction that an effect of sleep should be greater for problems requiring a broader solution search. We presented participants with a set of remote-associate tasks that varied in difficulty as a function of the strength of the stimuli–answer associations. After a period of sleep, wake, or no delay, participants reattempted previously unsolved problems. The sleep group solved a greater number of difficult problems than did the other groups, but no difference was found for easy problems. We conclude that sleep facilitates problem solving, most likely via spreading activation, but this has its primary effect for harder problems.},

A problem arises when a living creature has a goal but does not know how this goal is to be reached. Whenever one cannot go from the given situation to the desired situation simply by action, then there has to be recourse to thinking. The subjects (Ss), who were mostly students of universities or of colleges, were given various thinking problems, with the request that they think aloud. This instruction, "Think aloud", is not identical with the instruction to introspect which has been common in experiments on thought-processes. While the introspecter makes himself as thinking the object of his attention, the subject who is thinking aloud remains immediately directed to the problem, so to speak allowing his activity to become verbal. It is the shift of function of the components of a complex mathematical pattern—a shift which must so often occur if a certain structure is to be recognized in a given pattern—it is this restructuration, more precisely: this transformation of function within a system, which causes more or less difficulty for thinking, as one individual or another tries to find a mathematical proof.

	abstract = {The interdisciplinary nature of STEM education is a fertile ground for the development of transversal competencies. The study of STEM activities requires not only to consider domain-specific knowledge and skills, but also to possess several transversal competences, among them problem solving, creativity and computational thinking to fully benefit from the learning process initiated by these activities. Considering these transversal competencies separately leads to several points of tensions, from a more integrative, holistic point of view. Hence, it is necessary to look at these aspects from a more transdisciplinary position, eventually overcoming limits of disciplinary-orientated approaches thus linking the existing theoretical frameworks and pedagogical practices. In this article we describe how the techno-creative problem-solving framework (TCPS) could enrich the analysis of STEM teaching and learning from a transversal epistemological and didactical position. In order to investigate the transdisciplinary potential of TCPS, we provide the analysis of two problem-solving tasks, Tower of Hanoi and CreaCube. The analysis of these tasks through the TCPS raises the existing tensions on how problem solving, creativity and computational thinking are considered in different domains to highlight commonalities and differences between different approaches and to deepen the discussion about their possible connections.},

In this textbook there is a chapter on gender that focuses on cultural variations and historical changes in gender roles, in addition to discussions of gender issues in other chapters This textbook also has an entire chapter on work, which is central to the lives of adolescents in developing countries because a high proportion of them are not in school.

One of the key open issues in learning analytics is the standardization of the data collected. This is a particularly challenging issue in serious games, which generate a diverse range of data. This paper reviews the current state of learning analytics, data standards and serious games, studying how serious games are tracking the interactions from their players and the metrics that can be distilled from them. Based on this review, we propose an interaction model that establishes a basis for applying Learning Analytics into serious games. This paper then analyzes the current standards and specifications used in the field. Finally, it presents an implementation of the model with one of the most promising specifications: Experience API (xAPI). The Experience API relies on Communities of Practice developing profiles that cover different use cases in specific domains. This paper presents the Serious Games xAPI Profile: a profile developed to align with the most common use cases in the serious games domain. The profile is applied to a case study (a demo game), which explores the technical practicalities of standardizing data acquisition in serious games. In summary, the paper presents a new interaction model to track serious games and their implementation with the xAPI specification.},

However, manual annotation has limited scalability and is not conductive towards CPS assessments at scale. Objective We explore possibilities for automated annotation of actions in collaborative-teams, especially chat messages. We evaluate two approaches that employ machine learning for automated classification of CPS events. Method Data were collected from engineering, physics and electronics students' participation in a simulation-based task on electronics concepts, in which participants communicated via text-chat messages. All task activities were logged and time stamped. Data have been manually classified for the CPS skills, using an ontology that includes both social and cognitive dimensions. In this article, we describe computational linguistic methods for automatically classifying the CPS skills from logged data, with a view towards automating CPS assessments. Results We applied two machine learning methods to our data. A Naïve Bayes classifier has been previously used in CPS research, but it is only moderately successful on our data. We also present a k-nearest-neighbours (kNN) classifier that uses distributional semantic models for measuring text similarity. This classifier shows strong agreement between automated and human annotations. The study also demonstrates that automatic spelling correction and slang normalization of chat texts are useful for accurate automated annotation. Implications Our results suggest that a kNN classifier can be very effective for accurate annotation of CPS events. It achieves reasonably strong results even when trained on only half of the available data. This shows a promise towards reduction of manual data annotation for CPS measurement.},

However, little efforts have been done for exploring their potential. Objectives The goal of this study is to explore if and how social learning processes are occurring in online game communities. Methods n = 480 adult players completed a questionnaire including demographics, game community habits, and the game community of inquiry scale. Results were analysed by referring to social learning theory's processes and factors. Results and Conclusions Online game communities provide relevant instances of social learning, with an emphasis on soft skills and application to off-game contexts. Moreover, the more a community is inclusive and supporting, the more individuals learn and benefit from it from a cognitive perspective. Major takeaways This study provides a wide overview of the processes through which players observe, filter, and reproduce behaviours from their game communities of reference. Moreover, findings point at which malleable factors should be considered for facilitate this social learning dynamic, which are active participation, community receptiveness, and being aware of the learning process itself.},

ER also gives students the opportunity to work collaboratively. Objectives In this study, elementary school students' behavioral patterns were explored while they were working on a collaborative robotics project. Additionally, behavioral patterns of higher-achievement and lower-achievement groups were compared. Methods The participants of the study were a total of 18 students (aged 10–12), including 17 males and 1 female. A problem-based robotics competition was designed within the scope of the study. The students were asked to design and program a robot based on certain rules in groups within four weeks for this competition. All robot design processes and the competition were video-recorded. Quantitative content analysis and lag-sequential analysis methods were used to analyze students' behaviors. Results and Conclusions The results showed that ER improves collaborative learning, and behaviors in the contributing and planning categories were the dominant behaviors during the robotics project development. Grouping skills of higher-achievement groups were better. Based on the significant collaborative behavioral patterns that emerged from the study, implications were discussed in terms of theoretical insights and collaborative educational robotics practices.},

	abstract = {This chapter provides an overview of the experimental evidence on group problem solving, factors that inhibit and promote the effective problem solving, and the present state of group problem solving research. The major barriers to effective problem solving are those conditions, which prevent the free expression of ideas in a group. Factors both obvious and subtle, such as pressures toward uniformity may be detrimental to the group's effectiveness if it prevents search for and discussion of alternative possibilities. The sources of pressures could be personnel characteristics, group member's perceived ability, or prior experience. The larger the group the more inhibited the introverted people are, unless they have a strong stake in the outcome; and power structures in groups, while possibly mitigating the negative effects of personality factors, may also create new barriers to effective problem solving. Another contributor to ineffective problem solving is the failure of most groups to organize or plan their attack on the problem. There are several factors that promote the effective problem solving, such as intellectual ability of the group members, the member's motivation to work cooperatively on the problem, and the diversity of the points of view and information relevant to the problem within the group. A formally appointed leader can also enhance a group's effectiveness by ensuring the free expression of ideas; however, he hinders the group's operation, if he tends to dominate the discussion. The efforts directed to inventing and testing new ways of encouraging creative group problem solving should advance our understanding of the problem-solving process and, when successful, would have practical value for society as well.},

and are being used throughout the country on every level. The basic
elements of cooperative goal structure are positive interdependence,
individual accountability, face-to-face interaction, and cooperative
skills. The teacher's role in structuring cooperative learning
situations involves clearly specifying lesson objectives, placing
students in productive learning groups and providing appropriate
materials, clearly explaining the cooperative goal structure,
monitoring students, and evaluating performance. For cooperative
leaining groups to beproductive, students must be able to engage in
the needed collaborative skills. Cooperative skills and academic
skills can be taught simultaneously. The implementation of
cooperative learning needs to be coupled with the implementation of
collaborative professional support groups among educators. Both the
success of implementation efforts and the quality of life within most
schools depend on teachers and other staff members cooperating with
each other. Support for the program takes as careful strcturing and
monitoring as does cooperative learning. (JD)},

Twelve four-men groups worked on two different administrative problems.

The results corroborate previous evidence that interaction during the generation phase of problem solving is dysfunctional. Groups in which members interacted with one another during generation produced a smaller number of different solutions, fewer high-quality solutions and a smaller number of different kinds of solutions than groups in which members were constrained from interacting during generation. On the other hand, there was some evidence that interaction during the evaluation process is functional although the superiority of interacting groups over noninteracting groups in discriminating high- and low-quality solutions varied with the manner in which individual evaluations were combined in noninteracting groups.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The concept of “communities of practice,” a special facet of social constructivist learning theory, provides a new template against which we can examine the learning that goes on within permanent small groups of physicians. We interviewed participants and facilitators about the dynamics of these groups, their learning in conjunction with these groups, and the role the facilitator played to see the extent to which they captured the essence of communities of practice. Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted with physicians known to be participants or facilitators of small groups that met regularly. A constant comparative method was used for data gathering and analysis leading to coded themes, catagories, and subcategories. The coding schemas were tested, the analyses were reviewed, and data were recoded as necessary. To ensure accuracy, interviewees were provided with a preliminary copy of the manuscript to ensure that the interpretation of the data was appropriately handled. Results: Interviews were conducted with 10 facilitators and 22 group members representing 24 different groups of physicians. The groups appeared to function as communities of practice in which the members were supportive of each other's learning and respectful of one another, reporting little conflict. Members preferred to agree to disagree rather than pursue a “right” answer or consensus. Most of the discussion focused on scientific information and the way in which their colleagues approached common problems. Practice refinement rather than new directions in patient care appeared to be the goal. The facilitators in these groups played a key role in providing administrative support for the group and often the energy needed to sustain them. Discussion: Small groups that meet regularly provide a supportive network to share knowledge and validate clinical experience. There is some evidence that the groups have the potential to become communities of practice but do not actually achieve that level of sharing. Researth needs to be done to determine how these groups could become more powerful as communities of practice and vehicles for more substantive learning and change.},

These constructs arise from a model of conversation developed by Herbert Clark and sometimes referred to as “contribution theory.” We describe here the basic features of this theory and attempt to apply it in analyzing a fragment of enacted interaction. The interaction was recorded during an abdominal surgery performed with the aid of an endoscopic camera. We encountered difficulties, however, in applying contribution theory as an analytic framework within this concrete setting. We found further that the notion of common ground represents a confusing metaphor rather than a useful explanatory mechanism. We conclude with a suggestion that researchers in the future seek ways of constructing descriptions of joint activity that do not rely on the troublesome notions of grounding and common ground.},

	abstract = {In the field of computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL), scripts are designed to support collaboration among distant learners or co-present learners whose interactions are (at least partially) mediated by a computer. The rationale of scripts is to structure collaborative learning processes in order to trigger group interactions that may be rare in free collaboration. Fixing the degree of coercion is a delicate design choice: too rigid scripts would spoil the richness of collaborative interactions; too flexible scripts would fail to induce the targeted interactions. Because of the unpredictability of how scripts will be enacted, both the teacher and the students must be allowed to modify some script features. In this article we propose a conceptual analysis of this notion of flexibility, arguing for a dissociation of constraints that are intrinsic to the pedagogical design of the script and constraints induced by the technology or contextual factors. This difference sets up the limits of flexibility both for the teacher and for the students and provides specification for the computational design. This analysis leads to the conclusion that the operationalization of CSCL scripts should be addressed by implementing script engines handling multiple representations of the script: the script to be executed, the emergent organization of teams, the set of intrinsic and extrinsic constraints and the visual representation of the script for students and teachers.},

The pedagogical ideas are grounded on concepts of collaborative learning, including the socially shared origin of cognition, as well as self-regulated learning theory. This paper presents our three design experiments on mobile, handheld supported collaborative learning. All experiments are aimed at investigating novel ways to structure and regulate individual and collaborative learning with smartphones. In the first study a Mobile Lecture Interaction tool (M.L.I.) was used to facilitate higher education students' self-regulated learning in university lectures. In the second study smartphones were used as regulation tools to scaffold collaboration by supporting externalization of knowledge representations in individual and collaborative levels. The third study demonstrates how face to face and social software integrated collaborative learning supported with smartphones can be used for facilitating socially shared collaboration and community building. In conclusion, it is stressed that there is a need to place students in various situations in which they can engage in effortful interactions in order to build a shared understanding. Wireless networks and mobile tools will provide multiple opportunities for bridging different contents and contexts as well as virtual and face to face learning interactions in higher education.},

In this review, the authors consider how analyses of tutors’ actual behaviors may help to account for variation in learning outcomes and how typical tutoring behaviors may create or undermine opportunities for learning. The authors examine two tutoring activities that are commonly hypothesized to support tutor learning: explaining and questioning. These activities are hypothesized to support peer tutors’ learning via reflective knowledge-building, which includes self-monitoring of comprehension, integration of new and prior knowledge, and elaboration and construction of knowledge. The review supports these hypotheses but also finds that peer tutors tend to exhibit a pervasive knowledge-telling bias. Peer tutors, even when trained, focus more on delivering knowledge rather than developing it. As a result, the true potential for tutor learning may rarely be achieved. The review concludes by offering recommendations for how future research can utilize tutoring process data to understand how tutors learn and perhaps develop new training methods.},

The response rate was acceptable (73\%).Results: While there was a small change in attitudes towards openness in their professional role and group dynamics, there was a major change in two subgroups of students to these topics. The students who were least interested in collaborative constructivist learning and those students who mainly looked for practical value were the students who changed their attitudes most towards openness in their professional role.Conclusions: It appears that those students who would be least likely to voluntarily attend such a course were the ones who learned the most. This study does not allow for any generalizations regarding the outcome of experiential learning of group dynamics, but it is an argument for the use of systematic evaluations in order to identify students who can benefit from courses aimed at improving profound knowledge.},

The APS treatment was initially compared to two other control conditions, an information/education (IE) approach and treatment-as-usual or traditional rehabilitation (TR), with each of the control groups subsequently receiving the APS intervention in a crossover design. This design allowed for an evaluation of the treatment through assessment before and after treatment and on follow up, six months later. There was an improvement on some executive and functional measures after the implementation of the APS programme in the three groups. Size, and to a lesser extent laterality, of lesion affected baseline performance on measures of executive function, but there was no apparent relationship between size, laterality or site of lesion and level of benefit from the treatment intervention. The results were discussed in terms of models of executive functioning and the effectiveness of domain specific interventions in the rehabilitation of executive dysfunction.},

While classical collaboration scripts have been effective in providing such support, they have also been criticized for being coercive and not allowing students to self-regulate their learning. Adaptive collaboration support, which would provide students with assistance when and where they need it, is a possible solution. However, due to limitations of natural language processing, the development of adaptive support based on an analysis of student dialogue is difficult. To facilitate the implementation of adaptive collaboration support, we propose to leverage existing intelligent tutoring technology to provide support based on student problem-solving actions.

The articles collected in this special issue constitute a representative kaleidoscope of current research on peer assessment. In this commentary, we argue that research on peer assessment is currently in a stage of adolescence, grappling with the developmental tasks of identity formation and affiliation. Identity formation may be achieved by efforts towards a shared terminology and joint theory building, whereas affiliation may be reached by a more systematic consideration of research in related fields. To reach identity formation and affiliation, preliminary ideas for a cognitively toned, process-related model of peer assessment and links to related research fields, especially to research on collaborative learning, are presented.},

Ninety-two regular team meetings were videotaped. Interaction data were coded and evaluated with the act4teams coding scheme and INTERACT software. Team and organizational success variables were gathered via questionnaires and telephone interviews. The results support the central function of interaction processes as posited in the traditional input-process-output model. Teams that showed more functional interaction, such as problem-solving interaction and action planning, were significantly more satisfied with their meetings. Better meetings were associated with higher team productivity. Moreover, constructive meeting interaction processes were related to organizational success 2.5 years after the meeting. Dysfunctional communication, such as criticizing others or complaining, showed significant negative relationships with these outcomes. These negative effects were even more pronounced than the positive effects of functional team meeting interaction. The results suggest that team meeting processes shape both team and organizational outcomes. The critical meeting behaviors identified here provide hints for group researchers and practitioners alike who aim to improve meeting success.},

	abstract = {Les Serious Games sont des jeux vidéo qui n’ont pas pour objectif premier le divertissement et qui peuvent être utilisé pour l’enseignement. Pertinents dans de nombreux domaines d’éducation, ils posent pourtant des problèmes liés à leur création fastidieuse et coûteuse en moyens et en temps. Dans cette thèse, nous nous intéressons tout particulièrement aux Serious Games pour l’éducation, appelés Learning Games (LG) et plus particulièrement aux LG pour la formation continue pour les étudiants en école d’ingénieur. Tout d’abord, nous avons procédé à une étude des besoins concrets des créateurs de LG, ainsi qu’à un état de l’art des méthodologies et des outils existants. En premier lieu, ces recherches nous ont montré qu’il n’existait aucune solution adaptée pour faciliter la collaboration entre les différents concepteurs de LG, occupant des rôles complémentaires (expert du domaine, expert pédagogique, game designer…). Nos recherches mettent également en avant le besoin de modélisation et de représentation du scénario du LG pour aider les concepteurs à imaginer un LG qui soit à la fois ludique et attractif tout en gardant le fort potentiel éducatif indispensable à la formation. Pour répondre au premier besoin, nous proposons une méthodologie globale de création collaborative de LG, détaillant chaque tâche des acteurs ainsi que les outils mis à leur disposition. Pour répondre au deuxième besoin, nous proposons un modèle de scénarisation de LG qui représente d’un côté la structure pédagogique choisie par l’expert pédagogique et de l’autre côté la mise en scène ludique imaginée par le game designer. Pour réifier nos propositions, nous avons développé un environnement informatique d’aide à la conception, appelé LEGADEE (LEarning GAme DEsign Environment). LEGADEE guide chaque concepteur avec une « barre d’outils » adaptée à son rôle spécifique et qui propose également un système de validation qui analyse la création en cours. Enfin, nous avons imaginé un protocole d’évaluation pour valider notre environnement auteur ainsi que la méthodologie et le modèle proposés dans lequel nous comparons 24 scénarios de LG dont la moitié a été conçu avec LEGADEE et la moitié sans. Notre évaluation montre que l’utilisation de notre outil a tendance à améliorer certains critères qualité des LG. Elle montre aussi les limites de nos hypothèses et donne des pistes d’améliorations futures, tant sur LEGADEE que sur la méthode d’évaluation elle-même.},

This article examines the role of regulatory processes in collaborative learning and how CSCL environments can be used for shared regulation of learning. First, we establish the importance of regulation processes and introduce three types of regulation contributing to successful collaboration: self-, co-, and socially shared regulation of learning. Second, we illuminate two strands of seemingly diverse research that lay an important foundation for supporting and researching regulation in CSCL contexts establishing that (a) computer-based pedagogical tools used to successfully support regulation in individual learning contexts can be leveraged for collaborative task contexts, and (b) computer-based tools for supporting collaborative knowledge construction can be leveraged for supporting regulatory processes. Finally, we draw on emerging research in our own programs of research to demonstrate how regulation can be supported and researched in CSCL environments. The article concludes by charting a course for future CSCL research focused on supporting regulated learning in collaborative task contexts.},

An ill-structured problem-solving task was given to three groups. One group (Type QP) received instructor-generated question prompts that guided the problem-solving process; the second group (Type PQ) developed their own peer-generated questions; another group (Type PQ-R) developed their own question prompts first and revised them later with an instructor-generated question list. In this study, students in the QP group outperformed those in any other groups. The results revealed that providing instructor-generated question prompts was more effective than letting students develop their own questions, with or without revision, in ill-structured problem solving. Analysis of each of the four problem-solving stages revealed that the provided question prompts were more helpful in the stages of justification, and monitoring and evaluating than student-generated prompts. The difference between PQ and PQ-R groups is not statistically significant either overall or in any of the problem-solving stages.},

Within schools, teacher collaboration can foster communities of practice through a series of professional relationships that enhance the educational experience and learning outcomes of pupils with special educational needs (SEN). In Ireland, Learning Support Teachers (LSTs) and Resource Teachers (RTs) provide additional support to the increasing numbers of children with SEN in mainstream classrooms. Working alongside Classroom Teachers (CTs), this tripartite of teaching expertise represents an opportunity for whole-school and classroom-based approaches to successful collaborative, inclusive practice.This article describes the perceptions and experiences of collaborative practice between primary CTs, RTs and LSTs in a cohort of primary schools in the West of Ireland. Using a mixed methods approach, the study sought to establish the nature and extent of collaboration amongst these teachers and to identify the benefits and barriers to implementation.The findings suggest that whilst teachers are increasingly aware of the value of collaboration, its implementation is largely aspirational, with a series of challenges relating to time constraints, ad hoc planning and limited professional development opportunities most commonly identified as constraints to a consistent approach. The article considers the consequences of this shortfall and options for improved engagement between teachers are identified.},

The growing number of works in this subfield has the potential to impact multiple walks of human life including health, wellness, productivity, mobility, transportation, education, shopping, and sustenance. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we provide a functional survey of recent advances in sensing, understanding, and shaping human behavior, focusing on real-world behavior of users as measured using passive sensors. Second, we present a case study on how trust, which is an important building block of computational social systems, can be quantified, sensed, and applied to shape human behavior. Our findings suggest that:1) trust can be operationalized and predicted via computational methods (passive sensing and network analysis) and 2) trust has a significant impact on social persuasion; in fact, it was found to be significantly more effective than the closeness of ties in determining the amount of behavior change.},

Self-regulation of learning is processes students engage in as they set learning goals, implement strategies to reach those goals, monitor and assess their progress toward those goals, establish a productive learning environment, and maintain a sense of self-efficacy.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of team planning support in the form of awareness visualizations (quantified, nominal, and no visualization of individual planning perceptions summarized across group members) on the challenges students face during collaboration, and the ways they report regulating in the face of those challenges. Findings revealed differences across conditions. Individuals in the no visualization condition (a) rated planning as more problematic, and (b) were likely to encounter doing the task, checking progress, and group work challenges when they encounter planning challenges, (c) reported more time and planning main challenges compared to doing the task and group work challenges, and (d) reported that planning strategies (adopted as a team) were most effective for addressing planning challenges, followed by teamwork strategies which were less effective. In contrast, individuals belonging to groups who received one of the two visualizations (a) reported that both planning and teamwork strategies to be equally effective for addressing planning challenges, and (b) reported higher levels of success with their strategies than groups without a visualization support. Findings attest to the importance of supporting group planning with planning visualizations.},

In this paper, we provided a definition of Seed skill to become a self-regulated learner (S2SRL) as a basis terminology for developing our proposed framework, CREMA—Computer-Supported Meta-Reflective Learning Model via MWP in order to design an environment to encourage learners to use intrinsic comprehension of metacognitive questioning to acquire S2SRL in mathematical word problem (MWP) learning. To assess our proposed framework, we addressed these questions: (i) Can CREMA really support learner to gain S2SRL and (ii) How does it work in a practical environment? To answer these two questions, three classes of low performance students of grade 9 (total 101 students) were assigned into three different learning groups: (i) a group of students who learnt MWP with our proposed method by implementing CREMA, (ii) a group of students who learnt MWP in traditional method combining MetaQ—metacognitive questions and motivational statements, and (iii) a class of students who learnt MWP in traditional method. The result from our investigation showed that MetaQ played an important role in CREMA, while integrating computer and technology enhanced students’ learning sense and empowered methodology to facilitate learning objects in the implementation of CREMA to effectively support students to gain S2SRL in MWP learning.},

The period of switching roles between the driver and the navigator is often ignored by researchers. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the impact of the switching period on PP. We conducted a PP experiment in four classes in the sixth grade in a primary school. The results indicated that (a) the semi-free switch was more effective for the learning achievement than the fixed periods, and the preference for adopting the fixed time interval to switch roles existed in previous studies seems to be a kind of prejudice; (b) students who switched roles every 5 minutes and semi-freely were more enjoyable than those who switched roles in every task and in every class session. Moreover, the period of switching roles in every class session decreased students’ enjoyment after PP; (c) the frequency of switching roles decreased significantly, but the negotiation between the driver and the navigator became more active with time going in the semi-free class. Implications for teaching are also discussed.},

The primary purpose of this chapter is to provide a survey of recent developments in teamwork/collaboration measurement in an educational context. Key topics include conceptual frameworks, large-scale assessments, and innovative measurement techniques. Methodology/approach A range of methods for collecting and analyzing teamwork data are discussed, and five frameworks for measuring collaborative problem solving (CPS) over time are compared. Frameworks from Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), Assessment and Teaching of 21st Century Skills (ATC21S) project, Educational Testing Service (ETS), ACT, and von Davier and Halpin (2013) are discussed. Results of assessments developed from these frameworks are also considered. Social/practical implications New techniques for measuring team dynamics over time have great potential to improve education and work outcomes. Preliminary results of the assessments developed from these frameworks show that important advances in teamwork measurement have been enabled by innovative task designs, data-mining techniques, and novel applications of stochastic models. Originality/value This novel overview and comparison of interdisciplinary approaches will help to indicate where progress has been made and what challenges are ahead.},

We illustrate our learning analytics methods in the study of a supplemental instruction component for a large enrollment introductory statistics course recognized as a curriculum bottleneck at San Diego State University. As part of this application, we show how the ensemble estimate of the ITE may be used to assess the pedagogical reform (supplemental instruction), advise students into supplemental instruction at the beginning of the course, and quantify the impact of the supplemental instruction component on at-risk subgroups.},

The results show that during collaborative learning, the students engaged in monitoring in each self-regulated learning phase such as task understanding, planning and goal setting, task enactment, adaptation and reflection. The results of the HMM indicated that the learners' physiological reactivity was low when monitoring occurred. The associations between the states based on the HMM provide insights not only into how learners engage in metacognitive monitoring but also about their level of physiological reactivity in each state. In conclusion, exploring aspects of metacognitive monitoring in collaborative learning can be done with the help of physiological reactions.},

Specifically, we use Granger causality to analyse the causal relationships between collaborative and individual gaze measures from students working on a fractions intelligent tutoring system and the influence that the students' dialogue, prior knowledge, or success has on these relationships. We found that collaborative gaze patterns drive the individual focus in the pairs with high posttest scores and when they are engaged in problem-solving dialogues but the opposite with low performing students. Our work adds to the literature by extending the correlational relationships between individual and collaborative gaze measures to causal relationships and suggests indicators that can be used within an adaptive system.},

This study identified sequences of self- and socially shared regulatory activities in the online chats and logs of students completing a STEM task in a computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environment. High school and college students (N = 156) were randomly assigned to groups of three and asked to solve four tasks of increasing complexity in a virtual learning environment designed to teach students about electronics. The results revealed that the students engaged mostly in executing, self-monitoring, and socially shared monitoring activities. The successful groups demonstrated more frequent and more diverse regulatory activities than did the less successful groups. A Markov chain analysis revealed that the successful groups were most likely to start with self-executing and end with socially shared monitoring, while the less successful group were most likely to start with executing and end with self-executing. The results of this study reveal that the timing of socially shared monitoring influences the success of collaborative learning, which have implications for teaching practices and for adaptive scaffolding group learners in CSCL.},

Recent advances in sensor-based technologies such as facial expression analysis and gaze tracking have introduced the opportunity to leverage multimodal data streams for learning analytics. Learning analytics informed by multimodal data captured during students’ interactions with game-based learning environments hold significant promise for developing a deeper understanding of game-based learning, designing game-based learning environments to detect maladaptive behaviors and informing adaptive scaffolding to support individualized learning. This paper introduces a multimodal learning analytics approach that incorporates student gameplay, eye tracking and facial expression data to predict student posttest performance and interest after interacting with a game-based learning environment, Crystal Island. We investigated the degree to which separate and combined modalities (ie, gameplay, facial expressions of emotions and eye gaze) captured from students (n = 65) were predictive of student posttest performance and interest after interacting with Crystal Island. Results indicate that when predicting student posttest performance and interest, models utilizing multimodal data either perform equally well or outperform models utilizing unimodal data. We discuss the synergistic effects of combining modalities for predicting both student interest and posttest performance. The findings suggest that multimodal learning analytics can accurately predict students’ posttest performance and interest during game-based learning and hold significant potential for guiding real-time adaptive scaffolding.},

The paper reports from a project focused on organizational creativity at the group level, investigating what characterized such creative processes in that context. This project used ethnography as a qualitative method including participant observation, focus group interviews, and individual qualitative interviews. Furthermore, an inductive approach was used to analyze the data. Findings showed that when group members from different disciplines collaborated on innovative idea generation, the creative processes were characterized by a multivoiced stimulation of fantasy. In the paper, we first discuss how imagination involved new ways of combining knowledge and ideas based on one’s own and others experiences, including the use of technological tools. Secondly, we discuss how imagination was ignited by diversity and tension. Thirdly, we elaborate on the importance of emotion and support for the drive and stimulation of imagination in groups. Finally, we sum up the discussion by presenting a model based on the concept of Polyphonic Imagination, in order to visualize the characteristics of the creative processes. We propose this concept of Polyphonic Imagination, derived from the empirical data, to designate the ways in which different perspectives in the groups created tensions that fed into the group members´ imagination whenever these perspectives acknowledged each other.},

Roles raise individual group member’s awareness of their own and fellow group member’s responsibilities, and they make an individual’s responsibilities toward the group’s functioning visible for all group members.

Engagement was operationalised as group members' exhibited activities in the task space (i.e., discussing domain-content) and social space (i.e., regulating ideas, actions and socioemotional processes). Prior knowledge and achievement were operationalised as group members' performance on a domain-related pre-test and post-test, respectively. Data was collected for 95 triads of secondary education students collaborating on a complex business-economics problem. Subsequently, three different multilevel models were tested to examine the combined effect. First a model with the individual level measures (model 1) was tested and in subsequent models the group level measures (model 2) and within-group levels measures (model 3) were added. Findings indicate model 2 showed the best fit; group members' individual engagement in the social space activities as well as the groups' average prior knowledge positively predicts individual achievement. No effects were found for either group members' or groups' engagement in the task space and for the within-group differences.},

	abstract = {Educational technologies are often developed such that students work on specific social levels (e.g., individual, small group, whole class) at specific times. However, in the reality of the classroom, learning activities are not so cleanly divided, with transitions occurring between social levels for students at different times. To support these social transitions in a way that can promote student learning, we need to lower the teacher’s orchestration load around managing fluid social transitions. Co-orchestration, in which the orchestration decisions are shared between different parties, can help to lower the orchestration load when it is designed according to the teacher’s values and classroom culture. In this paper, we present a taxonomy of social transitions and investigate how the responsibilities of orchestration can be divided between primary school teachers and a co-orchestration system in order to support the extension from rigid social transitions to fluid transitions in technology-enhanced classrooms. Across two studies, we used a design process involving co-design and prototyping with teachers. We uncovered and refined co-orchestration design desires that balance teachers’ orchestration loads while providing them with a sense of control. We present six design desires for maintaining a balance between teacher and system responsibilities regarding the orchestration of social transitions that can be implemented, such as in our mid-fidelity prototype, to support the range of social transitions. The list of desires contributes to co-orchestration research and more broadly technology design for classrooms by highlighting the changing balance of teacher control depending on what is the focus of the orchestration support.},

It was during this meeting that I came to realize that Jim was one of those rare individuals that could help “translate” computer science principles to non-computer scientists. Through this translation process new knowledge could be developed through interdisciplinary partnerships with psychology and education. In this paper, I describe the manner in which Jim influenced my own journey in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Education. In particular, he has influenced two directions in my research, one direction is the manner in which technology can influence teaching and learning for individuals working solo. The second direction is how technology can influence teaching and learning through collaboration. In both situations I will discuss Jim Greer’s influence on my research with respect to learner modelling, educational data mining, and visualization. In the context of solo learning, I will discuss BioWorld, a system that fosters clinical reasoning in medical students, emphasizing the role of student modeling and educational data mining for fostering and identifying performance differences in clinical reasoning. In the context of collaborative learning, I will discuss HOWARD, an online platform for supporting small group problem-based learning in medical students. In particular, I will discuss the role of learning analytics used in a pedagogical dashboard to foster teachers’ interpretation of group learning.},

	abstract = {The present paper describes the design and evaluation of a videogame developed to support math education and overcome math anxiety (MA) at the primary school level. The game narrative is based on the history of math. The player travels back on time and meets on-player characters such as Pythagoras of Samos and Ada Lovelace, learning about how math was used during their times. The player is invited to play a minigame where the concepts shared by the characters are used as a strategy to win. The game’s evaluation consisted of a pre and post-testing study that measured students’ math performance and MA levels. The experiment also included a group interview to collect students’ perceptions about the game. The experiment lasted five weeks, and 88 students from three primary schools played the game on weekly sessions 45-60 minutes long. Statistical analysis suggested the game significantly improves students’ math performance. However, the results indicated that female students from one of the classrooms had higher MA levels after playing the game. In addition, qualitative data shows students had a high level of engagement with the gameplay.},

	abstract = {Background Realistic visualizations have been associated with benefits in retention performance, but also with disadvantages in transfer tasks. Realistic details are considered to be helpful for the initial learning of content, but not for the generalization to other domains and tasks. Objectives The contradictory nature of previous evidence needed to be tested in a situation in which both the retention of concrete surfaces as well as the transfer to different shapes is necessary. Methods Three experiments were conducted to assess whether transfer tasks in which knowledge of surfaces needed to be transferred to variations can benefit from realism, shape distinctness, and descriptive labels. In Experiment 1, participants learned skull anatomy either in a schematic or a realistic style and completed near and far transfer tests. In Experiment 2, the realism and shape distinctness of a fictional bone model was varied. Subjective cognitive load, retention performance, and transfer scores were measured. Experiment 3 compared how distinct and less distinct shapes of another fictional bone model affect learning in combination with label texts of differing semantic descriptiveness. Results and Conclusions In Experiment 1, performance in an anatomy learning task was raised by learning with a realistic visualization across near and far transfer tests. Experiment 2 revealed that extraneous cognitive load is increased for realistic visualizations when the depicted shapes lack distinctness. Experiment 3 suggests that when realistic visualizations feature less distinct shapes, learners struggle with descriptive labels in retention tests and benefit from similarly unspecific labels.},

	abstract = {The importance of learning design in education is widely acknowledged in the literature. Should learners make effective use of opportunities provided in a learning design, especially in online environments, previous studies have shown that they need to have strong skills for self-regulated learning (SRL). The literature, which reports the use of learning analytics (LA), shows that SRL skills are best exhibited in choices of learning tactics that are reflective of metacognitive control and monitoring. However, in spite of high significance for evaluation of learning experience, the link between learning design and learning tactics has been under-explored. In order to fill this gap, this paper proposes a novel learning analytic method that combines three data analytic techniques, including a cluster analysis, a process mining technique, and an epistemic network analysis. The proposed method was applied to a dataset collected in a massive open online course (MOOC) on teaching in flipped classrooms which was offered on a Chinese MOOC platform to pre- and in-service teachers. The results showed that the application of the approach detected four learning tactics (Search oriented, Content and assessment oriented, Content oriented and Assessment oriented) which were used by MOOC learners. The analysis of tactics’ usage across learning sessions revealed that learners from different performance groups had different priorities. The study also showed that learning tactics shaped by instructional cues were embedded in different units of study in MOOC. The learners from a high-performance group showed a high level of regulation through strong alignment of the choices of learning tactics with tasks provided in the learning design. The paper also provides a discussion about implications of research and practice.},

	abstract = {The Fourth Industrial Revolution has considerably sped up the pace of skill changes in many professional domains, with scores of new skills emerging and many old skills moving towards obsolescence. For these domains, identifying the new necessary skills in a timely manner is a difficult task, where existing methods are inadequate. Understanding the process, by which these new skills and technologies appear in and diffuse through a professional domain, could give training providers more time to identify these new skills and react. For this purpose, in the present work, we look at the dynamics between online learning platforms and online hiring platforms in the software programming profession, a rapidly evolving domain. To do so, we fuse four data sources together: Stack Overflow, an online community questions and answers (Q\&A) platform; Google Trends, which provides online search trends from Google; Udemy, a platform offering skill-based Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) where anyone can create courses; and Stack Overflow Jobs, a job ad platform. We place these platforms along two axes: i) how much expertise it takes, on average, to create content on them, and ii) whether, in general, the decision to create content on them is made by individuals or by groups. Our results show that the topics under study have a systematic tendency to appear earlier on platforms where content creation requires (on average) less expertise and is done more individually, rather than by groups: Stack Overflow is found to be more agile than Udemy, which is itself more agile than Stack Overflow Jobs (Google Trends did not prove usable due to extreme data sparsity). However, our results also show that this tendency is not present for all new skills, and that the software programming profession as a whole is remarkably agile: there are usually only a few months between the first Stack Overflow appearance of a new topic, and its first appearance on Udemy or Stack Overflow Jobs. In addition, we find that Udemy’s agility has dramatically increased over time. Our novel methodology is able to provide valuable insights into the dynamics between online education and job ad platforms, enabling training program creators to look at said dynamics for various topics and to understand the pace of change. This allows them to maintain better awareness of the trends and to prioritize their attention, both on the right topics and on the right platforms.},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005092},
	abstract = {A central task in the analysis of human movement behavior is to determine systematic patterns and differences across experimental conditions, participants and repetitions. This is possible because human movement is highly regular, being constrained by invariance principles. Movement timing and movement path, in particular, are linked through scaling laws. Separating variations of movement timing from the spatial variations of movements is a well-known challenge that is addressed in current approaches only through forms of preprocessing that bias analysis. Here we propose a novel nonlinear mixed-effects model for analyzing temporally continuous signals that contain systematic effects in both timing and path. Identifiability issues of path relative to timing are overcome by using maximum likelihood estimation in which the most likely separation of space and time is chosen given the variation found in data. The model is applied to analyze experimental data of human arm movements in which participants move a hand-held object to a target location while avoiding an obstacle. The model is used to classify movement data according to participant. Comparison to alternative approaches establishes nonlinear mixed-effects models as viable alternatives to conventional analysis frameworks. The model is then combined with a novel factor-analysis model that estimates the low-dimensional subspace within which movements vary when the task demands vary. Our framework enables us to visualize different dimensions of movement variation and to test hypotheses about the effect of obstacle placement and height on the movement path. We demonstrate that the approach can be used to uncover new properties of human movement., When you move a cup to a new location on a table, the movement of lifting, transporting, and setting down the cup appears to be completely automatic. Although the hand could take continuously many different paths and move on any temporal trajectory, real movements are highly regular and reproducible. From repetition to repetition movements vary, and the pattern of variance reflects movement conditions and movement timing. If another person performs the same task, the movement will be similar. When we look more closely, however, there are systematic individual differences. Some people will overcompensate when avoiding an obstacle and some people will systematically move slower than others. When we want to understand human movement, all these aspects are important. We want to know which parts of a movement are common across people and we want to quantify the different types of variability. Thus, the models we use to analyze movement data should contain all the mentioned effects. In this work, we developed a framework for statistical analysis of movement data that respects these structures of movements. We showed how this framework modeled the individual characteristics of participants better than other state-of-the-art modeling approaches. We combined the timing-and-path-separating model with a novel factor analysis model for analyzing the effect of obstacles on spatial movement paths. This combination allowed for an unprecedented ability to quantify and display different sources of variation in the data. We analyzed data from a designed experiment of arm movements under various obstacle avoidance conditions. Using the proposed statistical models, we documented three findings: a linearly amplified deviation in mean path related to increase in obstacle height; a consistent asymmetric pattern of variation along the movement path related to obstacle placement; and the existence of obstacle-distance invariant focal points where mean trajectories intersect in the frontal and vertical planes.},

The nonlinear alignment procedure is designed to pairwise generate optimally aligned EPs by backtracking along the optimal alignment path. The nonlinear alignment and averaging operations are systematically combined to develop methods to estimate the EP.

AI systems to support co-creativity in learning are highly underinvestigated, and very little is known about the dialogue mechanisms that support learning during collaborative co-creativity. To address this need, we analyzed the structure of collaborative dialogue between pairs of high school students who co-created music by writing code. We used hidden Markov models to analyze 68 co-creative dialogues consisting of 3,305 total utterances. The results distinguish seven hidden states: three of the hidden states are characterized by conversation, such as social, aesthetic, or technical dialogue. The remaining four hidden states are characterized by task actions including code editing, accessing the curriculum, running the code successfully, and receiving an error when running the code. The model reveals that immediately after the pairs ran their code successfully, they often transitioned into the aesthetic or technical dialogue state. However, when facing code errors, learners were unlikely to transition into a conversation state. In the few cases where they did transition to a conversation state, this transition was almost always to the technical dialogue state. These findings reveal processes of human co-creativity and can inform the design of intelligent co-creative agents that support human collaboration and learning.},

Decentralized learning, also known as federated learning, aims to allow a set of participants with local datasets to collaboratively train machine learning models while keeping their data decentralized. A key challenge in this context is to design decentralized algorithms that (i) can efficiently solve a variety of learning tasks on highly heterogeneous local datasets, and (ii) provide rigorous privacy guarantees while minimizing the impact on the utility of the learned models. To tackle these challenges, I describe three sets of contributions. First, I present a decentralized approach to collaboratively learn a personalized model for each user. Second, I address the problem of decentralized estimation and learning with pairwise loss functions. In both cases, privacy-preserving versions of these algorithms are introduced under the strong model of local differential privacy. Finally, to reduce the cost in utility induced by local differential privacy, I propose two approaches to improve the privacy-utility trade-offs of decentralized learning through appropriate relaxations of the local model.},

Researchers have leveraged games, augmented reality and other ways to make learning ML concepts interesting. However, most of the existing games to teach ML concepts either focus on use-cases and applications of ML instead of core concepts or directly introduce ML terminologies, which might be overwhelming to school students. Hence, in this paper, we propose ML-Quest, a game to incrementally present a conceptual overview of three ML concepts: Supervised Learning, Gradient Descent and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) Classification. The game has been evaluated through a controlled experiment, for its usefulness and player experience using the TAM model, with 41 higher-secondary school students. Results show that students in the experimental group perform better in the test than students in the control group, with 5\% of students in the experimental group scoring full marks. However, none of the students in the control group could score full marks. The survey results indicate that around 77\% of the participants who played the game either agree or strongly agree that ML-Quest has made their learning interactive and is helpful in introducing them to ML concepts.},

	abstract = {Scientists study trajectory data to understand trends in movement patterns, such as human mobility for traffic analysis and urban planning. There is a pressing need for scalable and efficient techniques for analyzing this data and discovering the underlying patterns. In this paper, we introduce a novel technique which we call vector-field \$k\$-means. The central idea of our approach is to use vector fields to induce a similarity notion between trajectories. Other clustering algorithms seek a representative trajectory that best describes each cluster, much like \$k\$-means identifies a representative "center" for each cluster. Vector-field \$k\$-means, on the other hand, recognizes that in all but the simplest examples, no single trajectory adequately describes a cluster. Our approach is based on the premise that movement trends in trajectory data can be modeled as flows within multiple vector fields, and the vector field itself is what defines each of the clusters. We also show how vector-field \$k\$-means connects techniques for scalar field design on meshes and \$k\$-means clustering. We present an algorithm that finds a locally optimal clustering of trajectories into vector fields, and demonstrate how vector-field \$k\$-means can be used to mine patterns from trajectory data. We present experimental evidence of its effectiveness and efficiency using several datasets, including historical hurricane data, GPS tracks of people and vehicles, and anonymous call records from a large phone company. We compare our results to previous trajectory clustering techniques, and find that our algorithm performs faster in practice than the current state-of-the-art in trajectory clustering, in some examples by a large margin.},

Dans ce contexte, notre étude vise à analyser l’exploration créative réalisée avec des pièces de robotique modulaire inconnues par les participants. Trois sujets ont été engagés sur une tâche consistant à créer un véhicule autonome pouvant se déplacer d’un point A à un point B. La création du véhicule exige la manipulation et l’assemblage de quatre pièces de robotique modulaire Cubelets.

	abstract = {We report on a new setup allowing us to collect learning analytics (LA) during computational thinking unplugged or tangible playful activities. We target the development of computational thinking (CT) competency, including the initiation to informatics (i.e., computer science and technology), with the goal to evaluate and analyze the development of CT. Collecting LA is mandatory in this case and if adaptive learning is targeted. While collecting LA during online interactions is rather straightforward, automatically collecting LA when manipulating tangible objects is more challenging, especially in a context where low-cost greenIT material is required. The key idea here, contrary to usual “black-box” systems working (more or less) automatically, is to change the learning paradigm and involve the learner in the data collection, making the process transparent and allowing her or him to also learn how to learn. This is particularly pertinent here since we use Informatics tools in order to … initiate to Informatics and CT. This means that we have to redesign the activity scenario including its didactic and revisit the underneath pedagogy, which turns to be an interesting and innovative challenge.},

Si certains de ces usages n’apportent pas de plus-values pédagogiques, d’autres permettent aux élèves de s’engager dans des processus de cocréation. Le présent ouvrage apporte un éclairage sur les approches créatives du numérique en enseignement et sur leur potentiel et leur contribution à l’éducation personnelle, sociale et professionnelle des citoyens du XXIe siècle. Par une approche critique, cet ouvrage analyse les enjeux éducatifs du numérique, en tenant compte de sa complexité, de l’interdisciplinarité de ses apports et des compétences dites « du XXIe siècle ». Parmi ces com­pétences, la créativité et la résolution collaborative de problème sont présentées de manière plus approfondie à partir d’exemples de défis technocréatifs ludiques qui favorisent l’engagement des apprenants. Les auteurs abordent également différentes approches des usages créatifs du numérique, de l’apprentissage par les jeux à la robotique pédagogique en passant par les approches liées aux laboratoires de création numérique. Enfin, ils se penchent sur la mise en œuvre des compétences numériques des enseignants et d’un leadership pouvant favoriser l’intégration des usages créatifs du numérique dans l’ensei­gnement. Tout au long du livre sont présentés des témoignages qui illustrent de manière concrète les différentes idées pédagogiques étudiées. Ces idées pratiques sont le résultat de recherches visant à fournir des outils aux différents acteurs de l’éducation du XXIe siècle : super-héros enseignants et parents, sans oublier les conseillers pédagogiques et les décideurs politiques.},

The hippocampus has been suggested to play a pivotal role in both learning environmental statistics, as well as exploiting them to generate perceptual predictions. However, it is unclear how the hippocampus balances encoding new predictive associations with the retrieval of existing ones. Here, we present the results of two high resolution human fMRI studies (N=24 for both experiments) directly investigating this. Participants were exposed to auditory cues that predicted the identity of an upcoming visual shape (with 75\% validity). Using multivoxel decoding analysis, we found that the hippocampus initially preferentially represented unexpected shapes (i.e., those that violated the cue regularities), but later switched to representing the cue-predicted shape regardless of which was actually presented. These findings demonstrate that the hippocampus in involved both acquiring and exploiting predictive associations, and switches between these modes depending on whether learning is ongoing or complete.},

	abstract = {Coordinated skills such as speech or dance involve sequences of actions that follow syntactic rules in which transitions between elements depend on the identities and order of past actions. Canary songs consist of repeated syllables called phrases, and the ordering of these phrases follows long-range rules1 in which the choice of what to sing depends on the song structure many seconds prior. The neural substrates that support these long-range correlations are unknown. Here, using miniature head-mounted microscopes and cell-type-specific genetic tools, we observed neural activity in the premotor nucleus HVC2–4 as canaries explored various phrase sequences in their repertoire. We identified neurons that encode past transitions, extending over four phrases and spanning up to four seconds and forty syllables. These neurons preferentially encode past actions rather than future actions, can reflect more than one song history, and are active mostly during the rare phrases that involve history-dependent transitions in song. These findings demonstrate that the dynamics of HVC include ‘hidden states’ that are not reflected in ongoing behaviour but rather carry information about prior actions. These states provide a possible substrate for the control of syntax transitions governed by long-range rules.},

Non-adjacent correlations can be found in the syntax of some birdsongs, indicating that the choice of what to sing next is determined not only by the current syllable, but also by previous syllables sung. Here we examine the song of the domesticated canary, a complex singer whose song consists of syllables, grouped into phrases that are arranged in flexible sequences. Phrases are defined by a fundamental time-scale that is independent of the underlying syllable duration. We show that the ordering of phrases is governed by long-range rules: the choice of what phrase to sing next in a given context depends on the history of the song, and for some syllables, highly specific rules produce correlations in song over timescales of up to ten seconds. The neural basis of these long-range correlations may provide insight into how complex behaviors are assembled from more elementary, stereotyped modules.},

The question is itself treated as a text to be analyzed. Seven critical key terms are selected for interpretation: how, have, method, analyze, 1,000 pages, transcripts, and collected. The interpretation focuses on both what is said and what is not said in the question, as well as what could have been said to lead interview analyses in more constructive directions.

	abstract = {In recent years Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) has emerged as the distance measure of choice for virtually all time series data mining applications. For example, virtually all applications that process data from wearable devices use DTW as a core sub-routine. This is the result of significant progress in improving DTW’s efficiency, together with multiple empirical studies showing that DTW-based classifiers at least equal (and generally surpass) the accuracy of all their rivals across dozens of datasets. Thus far, most of the research has considered only the one-dimensional case, with practitioners generalizing to the multi-dimensional case in one of two ways, dependent or independent warping. In general, it appears the community believes either that the two ways are equivalent, or that the choice is irrelevant. In this work, we show that this is not the case. The two most commonly used multi-dimensional DTW methods can produce different classifications, and neither one dominates over the other. This seems to suggest that one should learn the best method for a particular application. However, we will show that this is not necessary; a simple, principled rule can be used on a case-by-case basis to predict which of the two methods we should trust at the time of classification. Our method allows us to ensure that classification results are at least as accurate as the better of the two rival methods, and, in many cases, our method is significantly more accurate. We demonstrate our ideas with the most extensive set of multi-dimensional time series classification experiments ever attempted.},

The technique is a variation of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Hinton and Roweis, 2002) that is much easier to optimize, and produces significantly better visualizations by reducing the tendency to crowd points together in the center of the map. t-SNE is better than existing techniques at creating a single map that reveals structure at many different scales. This is particularly important for high-dimensional data that lie on several different, but related, low-dimensional manifolds, such as images of objects from multiple classes seen from multiple viewpoints. For visualizing the structure of very large data sets, we show how t-SNE can use random walks on neighborhood graphs to allow the implicit structure of all of the data to influence the way in which a subset of the data is displayed. We illustrate the performance of t-SNE on a wide variety of data sets and compare it with many other non-parametric visualization techniques, including Sammon mapping, Isomap, and Locally Linear Embedding. The visualiza-tions produced by t-SNE are significantly better than those produced by the other techniques on almost all of the data sets.},

Participants viewed a series of meme pairs depicting depressive and neutral memes for periods of 4000 ms.

Existing research using surveys or choice experiments in the lab environment may not be able to capture actual consumer behaviors and preferences. This study examines the effectiveness of ecolabels in informing sustainable consumption by using data collected from 156 participants in the naturalistic shopping environment using eye tracking glasses. Our results show that: 1) USDA Organic and NON GMO were the two most frequently identified ecolabels on the purchased products; 2) a majority of the participants (54\%) did not evaluate any product information at all for any of the items they purchased, while only 10\% of the products purchased from all participants were evaluated, which indicates that most of the products were purchased through habitual shopping; 3) consumers' revealed preferences of ecolabeled products (through purchase actions) were lower than the stated preferences (through survey or hypothetical choice experiments); and 4) competing with other product information, ecolabels received little attention and awareness from consumers. Potential ways to help improve the effectiveness of ecolabels in promoting sustainable consumption include: 1) educating consumers on the presence and meaning of ecolabels to help establish ecolabeled products as parts of the habitual shopping products; and 2) leveraging consumers’ attentions to other product information (e.g., price, nutrition table) to help increase the visibility of ecolabels.},

However, robust fixation detection in mobile settings is profoundly challenging given the prevalence of user and gaze target motion. These movements feign a shift in gaze estimates in the frame of reference defined by the eye tracker's scene camera. To address this challenge, we present a novel fixation detection method for head-mounted eye trackers. Our method exploits that, independent of user or gaze target motion, target appearance remains about the same during a fixation. It extracts image information from small regions around the current gaze position and analyses the appearance similarity of these gaze patches across video frames to detect fixations. We evaluate our method using fine-grained fixation annotations on a five-participant indoor dataset (MPIIEgoFixation) with more than 2,300 fixations in total. Our method outperforms commonly used velocity- and dispersion-based algorithms, which highlights its significant potential to analyse scene image information for eye movement detection.},

Monitoring eye movements using a head-mounted eye-camera allows one to use the locations and latencies of fixations to examine spoken word recognition during continuous speech in natural contexts. Preliminary work using this paradigm provides striking evidence for the continuous and incremental nature of comprehension, as well as clear effects of visual context on the earliest moments of linguistic processing. We review the eye-movement paradigm and refer to recent experiments applying the paradigm to issues of spoken word recognition (e.g. lexical competitor effects), syntactic processing (e.g. the interaction of referential context and ambiguity resolution), reference resolution (disambiguating temporarily ambiguous referential phrases), focus (modulating the salience of certain objects via contrastive stress), as well as issues in cross-modality integration that are central to evaluating the modularity hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Bayesian modeling of cognition has undergone a recent rise in prominence, due largely to mathematical advances in specifying and deriving predictions from complex probabilistic models. Much of this research aims to demonstrate that cognitive behavior can be explained from rational principles alone, without recourse to psychological or neurological processes and representations. We note commonalities between this rational approach and other movements in psychology, namely Behaviorism and Evolutionary Psychology, that set aside mechanistic explanation or make use of optimality assumptions. Through these comparisons, we identify a number of challenges that limit the rational program’s potential contribution to psychological theory. Specifically, rational Bayesian models are significantly unconstrained, both because they are uninformed by a wide range of process-level data and because their assumptions about the environment are generally not grounded in empirical measurement. The psychological implications of most Bayesian models are also unclear. Bayesian inference itself is conceptually trivial, but strong assumptions are often embedded in the hypothesis sets and the approximation algorithms used to derive model predictions, without a clear delineation between psychological commitments and implementational details. Comparing multiple Bayesian models of the same task is rare, as is the realization that many Bayesian models recapitulate existing (mechanistic-level) theories. Despite the expressive power of current Bayesian models, we argue they must be developed in conjunction with mechanistic considerations to offer substantive explanations of cognition. We lay out several means for such an integration, which take into account the representations on which Bayesian inference operates, as well as the algorithms and heuristics that carry it out. We argue this unification will better facilitate lasting contributions to psychological theory, avoiding the pitfalls that have plagued previous theoretical movements.},

These approaches include binding through synchrony (Shastri \& Ajjanagadde, 1993), “mesh” binding (van der Velde \& de Kamps, 2006), and conjunctive binding (Smolensky, 1990). Recent theoretical work has suggested that most of these methods will not scale well, that is, that they cannot encode structured representations using any of the tens of thousands of terms in the adult lexicon without making implausible resource assumptions. Here, we empirically demonstrate that the biologically plausible structured representations employed in the Semantic Pointer Architecture (SPA) approach to modeling cognition (Eliasmith, 2013) do scale appropriately. Speciﬁcally, we construct a spiking neural network of about 2.5 million neurons that employs semantic pointers to successfully encode and decode the main lexical relations in WordNet, which has over 100,000 terms. In addition, we show that the same representations can be employed to construct recursively structured sentences consisting of arbitrary WordNet concepts, while preserving the original lexical structure. We argue that these results suggest that semantic pointers are uniquely well-suited to providing a biologically plausible account of the structured representations that underwrite human cognition.},

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) empowers the agent to learn robotic manipulation skills autonomously. Compared with traditional single-goal RL, semantic-goal-conditioned RL expands the agent capacity to accomplish multiple semantic manipulation instructions. However, due to sparsely distributed semantic goals and sparse-reward agent-environment interactions, the hard exploration problem arises and impedes the agent training process. In traditional RL, curiosity-motivated exploration shows effectiveness in solving the hard exploration problem. However, in semantic-goal-conditioned RL, the performance of previous curiosity-motivated methods deteriorates, which we propose is because of their two defects: uncontrollability and distraction. To solve these defects, we propose a conservative curiosity-motivated method named mutual information motivation with hybrid policy mechanism (MIHM). MIHM mainly contributes two innovations: the decoupled-mutual-information-based intrinsic motivation, which prevents the agent from being motivated to explore dangerous states by uncontrollable curiosity; the precisely trained and automatically switched hybrid policy mechanism, which eliminates the distraction from the curiosity-motivated policy and achieves the optimal utilization of exploration and exploitation. Compared with four state-of-the-art curiosity-motivated methods in the sparse-reward robotic manipulation task with 35 valid semantic goals, including stacks of 2 or 3 objects and pyramids, our MIHM shows the fastest learning speed. Moreover, MIHM achieves the highest 0.9 total success rate, which is up to 0.6 in other methods. Throughout all the baseline methods, our MIHM is the only one that achieves to stack three objects.},

	abstract = {One of the fundamental human cognitive processes is problem solving. As a higher-layer cognitive process, problem solving interacts with many other cognitive processes such as abstraction, searching, learning, decision making, inference, analysis, and synthesis on the basis of internal knowledge representation by the object–attribute-relation (OAR) model. Problem solving is a cognitive process of the brain that searches a solution for a given problem or ﬁnds a path to reach a given goal. When a problem object is identiﬁed, problem solving can be perceived as a search process in the memory space for ﬁnding a relationship between a set of solution goals and a set of alternative paths. This paper presents both a cognitive model and a mathematical model of the problem solving process. The cognitive structures of the brain and the mechanisms of internal knowledge representation behind the cognitive process of problem solving are explained. The cognitive process is formally described using real-time process algebra (RTPA) and concept algebra. This work is a part of the cognitive computing project that designed to reveal and simulate the fundamental mechanisms and processes of the brain according to Wang’s layered reference model of the brain (LRMB), which is expected to lead to the development of future generation methodologies for cognitive computing and novel cognitive computers that are capable of think, learn, and perceive.},

	abstract = {Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is the problem of recovering the underlying reward function from the behavior of an expert. Most of the existing IRL algorithms assume that the environment is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP), although it is desirable to handle partially observable settings in order to handle more realistic scenarios. In this paper, we present IRL algorithms for partially observable environments that can be modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We deal with two cases according to the representation of the given expert’s behavior, namely the case in which the expert’s policy is explicitly given, and the case in which the expert’s trajectories are available instead. The IRL in POMDPs poses a greater challenge than in MDPs since it is not only ill-posed due to the nature of IRL, but also computationally intractable due to the hardness in solving POMDPs. To overcome these obstacles, we present algorithms that exploit some of the classical results from the POMDP literature. Experimental results on several benchmark POMDP domains show that our work is useful for partially observable settings.},

	abstract = {Generative AI Art: Copyright Infringement and Fair Use, SMU SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY LAW REVIEW, vol. 26-2 (forthcoming, 2023).-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The discussion of AI copyright infringement or fair use often skips over all of the required steps of the infringement analysis in order to focus on the most intriguing question, “Could a visual generative AI generate a work that potentially infringes a preexisting copyrighted work?” and then the discussion skips further ahead to, “Would the AI have a fair use defense, most likely under the transformative test?”  These are relevant questions, but in isolation from the actual steps of the copyright infringement analysis, the discussion is misleading or even irrelevant. This skipping of topics and stages of the infringement analysis does not train our attention to a properly accused party or entity whose actions prompt the question. The leaping from a question of infringement in the creation of training datasets to the creation of foundation models that draw from the training data to the actual operation of the generative AI system to produce images makes a false equivalency regarding the processes themselves and the persons responsible for them. The questions ought to shift focus from the persons compiling the training dataset used to train the AI system and the designers and creators of the AI system itself to the end users of the AI system who actually conceive of and cause the creation of images. The analysis of infringement or fair use in the generative AI context has suffered from widespread misunderstanding concerning the generative AI processes and the control and authorship of the end-user. Claimants, commentators, and regulators have made incorrect assumptions and inaccurate simplifications concerning the process, which I refer to as the Magic File Drawer theory, the Magic Copy Machine theory, and the Magic Box Artist theory. These theories, if they were true, would be much easier to envision and understand than the actual science and technology that goes into the creation and operation of a contemporary visual generative AI system. Throughout this Article, I will attempt to clarify and correct the understanding of the science and technology of the generative AI processes and explain the different roles of the training dataset designers, the generative AI system designers, and the end-users in the rendering of visual works by a generative AI system. Part II will discuss the requirements of a claim of copyright infringement including each step from the copyrightability of the claimant’s work, the doctrines that limit copyrightability, the requirement of an act of copying, and the infringement elements. Part III will summarize the copyright fair use test paying particular attention to the purpose and character of the use analysis, 17 U.S.C. § 107(1), and the current interpretation of the “transformative” test after Andy Warhol Foundation v. Goldsmith, particularly in circumstances relating to technology and the use of copyrighted or copyrightable data sources. Part IV will analyze potential infringement or fair use by the creators of generative AI training datasets. Part V will analyze potential infringement or fair use by the creators of visual generative AI systems. Part VI will analyze potential infringement or fair use by the end-users of visual generative AI systems.For all their complexity, visual generative AI systems are tools that depend on an end-user who conceives of and designs the image and provides the system with a prompt to set the generative process in motion. The end-users are responsible for crafting the prompt or series of prompts used, for evaluating the outputs of the generative AI, for adjusting and editing the iterations of images offered by the AI system, and ultimately for selecting and adopting one of the images generated by the AI as the final image. The end-users then make further decisions about the actual use and its function and purpose for the images the end-users selected and adopted from the outputs of the AI. In the course of working with the AI tool to try to produce a certain image, an end-user might steer the system to produce a work that could, under an infringement analysis, be regarded as potentially infringing, which would lead us again to the fair use analysis based on the end-user’s use of the image.},

	abstract = {The Wason selection task is a tool used to study reasoning about conditional rules. Performance on this task changes systematically when one varies its content, and these content effects have been used to argue that the human cognitive architecture contains a number of domain-specific representation and inference systems, such as social contract algorithms and hazard management systems. Recently, however, Sperber, Cara \& Girotto (Sperber, D., Cara, F., \& Girotto, V. (1995). Relevance theory explains the selection task. Cognition, 57, 31–95) have proposed that relevance theory can explain performance on the selection task – including all content effects – without invoking inference systems that are content-specialized. Herein, we show that relevance theory alone cannot explain a variety of content effects – effects that were predicted in advance and are parsimoniously explained by theories that invoke domain-specific algorithms for representing and making inferences about (i) social contracts and (ii) reducing risk in hazardous situations. Moreover, although Sperber et al. (1995) were able to use relevance theory to produce some new content effects in other domains, they conducted no experiments involving social exchanges or precautions, and so were unable to determine which – content-specialized algorithms or relevance effects – dominate reasoning when the two conflict. When experiments, reported herein, are constructed so that the different theories predict divergent outcomes, the results support the predictions of social contract theory and hazard management theory, indicating that these inference systems override content-general relevance factors. The fact that social contract and hazard management algorithms provide better explanations for performance in their respective domains does not mean that the content-general logical procedures posited by relevance theory do not exist, or that relevance effects never occur. It does mean, however, that one needs a principled way of explaining which effects will dominate when a set of inputs activate more than one reasoning system. We propose the principle of pre-emptive specificity – that the human cognitive architecture should be designed so that more specialized inference systems pre-empt more general ones whenever the stimuli centrally fit the input conditions of the more specialized system. This principle follows from evolutionary and computational considerations that are common to both relevance theory and the ecological rationality approach.},

However, it is unclear why arithmetic operators correspond to non-linear embedding models such as skip-gram with negative sampling (SGNS). We provide a formal explanation of this phenomenon without making the strong assumptions that past theories have made about the vector space and word distribution. Our theory has several implications. Past work has conjectured that linear substructures exist in vector spaces because relations can be represented as ratios; we prove that this holds for SGNS. We provide novel justification for the addition of SGNS word vectors by showing that it automatically down-weights the more frequent word, as weighting schemes do ad hoc. Lastly, we offer an information theoretic interpretation of Euclidean distance in vector spaces, justifying its use in capturing word dissimilarity.},

Firstly, we review some key characteristics of Bayesian systems - they integrate information making rational use of uncertainty, they apply prior knowledge in the interpretation of new observations, and (for several reasons) they are very effective learners. Secondly, we illustrate how some well-known psychological phenomena including visual illusions, categorical perception and attention can be understood in terms of Bayesian inference. We also consider how formal models can clarify our understanding of psychological constructs, by giving a truly computational definition of psychological processes. Finally, we consider how probabilistic representations and hence Bayesian algorithms could be implemented by neural populations. In particular, we explore how different types of population coding may lead to different predictions about activity in both single-unit and imaging studies, and draw a distinction in this context between the representation of parameters and implementation of computations.},

Individual approach to learners’ needs posits the necessity to comply with the characteristics of their preferences and predispositions for learning, which ought to be considered in tutoring content delivery. Adapting the instruction material to a particular learner requires intelligent tutoring system (ITS). In turn, the adaptation mechanism itself is based on comprehensive data analytics derived from the learning environment and the learner’s behaviour as well. The paper presents a new approach in which intelligent tutor can deliver a support on meta level of learning process through analytics and adaptability. Most commonly, the analytics and adaptation in ITS are targeted mainly at the instruction program, but since the individual approach assumes that each learner should be treated individually, we must consider replacing active role of a human teacher, by the functionality of the intelligent tutor. Therefore, the role of supervising the learning process depends on the user themselves. It means that the meta-learning process has to be the subject of analysis and adjustment. Users usually do not have enough knowledge about how to learn, and for that reason the task of monitoring learner’s performance and adjusting all activities should be ensured by the system.},

However, recruiting human observers and acquiring enough data to analyze their behavior when exploring virtual environments requires complex hardware and software setups, and can be time-consuming. Being able to generate virtual observers can help overcome this limitation, and thus stands as an open problem in this medium. Particularly, generative adversarial approaches could alleviate this challenge by generating a large number of scanpaths that reproduce human behavior when observing new scenes, essentially mimicking virtual observers. However, existing methods for scanpath generation do not adequately predict realistic scanpaths for 360° images. We present ScanGAN360, a new generative adversarial approach to address this problem. We propose a novel loss function based on dynamic time warping and tailor our network to the specifics of 360° images. The quality of our generated scanpaths outperforms competing approaches by a large margin, and is almost on par with the human baseline. ScanGAN360 allows fast simulation of large numbers of virtual observers, whose behavior mimics real users, enabling a better understanding of gaze behavior, facilitating experimentation, and aiding novel applications in virtual reality and beyond.},

On the perceptual side, the dominant cognitive view largely underestimates, and thus fails to account for, the impact of action-related processes on both the processing of perceptual information and on perceptual learning. On the action side, most approaches conceive of action planning as a mere continuation of stimulus processing, thus failing to account for the goal-directedness of even the simplest reaction in an experimental task. We propose a new framework for a more adequate theoretical treatment of perception and action planning, in which perceptual contents and action plans are coded in a common representational medium by feature codes with distal reference. Perceived events (perceptions) and to-be-produced events (actions) are equally represented by integrated, task-tuned networks of feature codes--cognitive structures we call event codes. We give an overview of evidence from a wide variety of empirical domains, such as spatial stimulus-response compatibility, sensorimotor synchronization, and ideomotor action, showing that our main assumptions are well supported by the data.},

Theses technologies can foster interaction, immersion, and collaboration among students, benefits that are known to enhance various aspects of learning. However, collaboration in virtual reality (VR) can be challenging. Habits of collaboration developed in real life may not necessarily translate to such an environment. For instance, the lack of "social cues" in VR, such as facial expressions, may affect communication and problem solving, thus requiring us to adapt and reflect on how to apply this technology in educational settings. Nonetheless, VR also offers highly interesting new perspectives for education, enabling us to imagine new ways of working together. Therefore, it becomes imperative to closely explore the process of collaboration in VR, with a focus on learning, an area where VR is experiencing significant growth. In this regard, we take an existing educational task designed specifically for creative problem solving, and adapt it for VR. We build around this task a VR application that allows collaboration between two or more individuals engaging in problem solving. Our application provides a unique opportunity to study the collaborative processes involved in the specific context of learning, thereby opening new avenues to enhance educational experiences through VR.},

This system is applied to modeling several classic phenomena in the literature that depend on the speed and selectivity with which visual attention can move across a visual display. ACT-R is capable of interacting with the same computer screens that subjects do and, as such, is well suited to provide a model for tasks involving human–computer interaction.

The problems range from ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. The Design of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible. The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural relationships that couple function and control, and make intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the right time. The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on how -- and why -- some products satisfy customers while others only frustrate them.},

Il a immédiatement suscité l'intérêt - parfois critique - des psychologues du monde entier. Trois quarts de siècle après sa parution, il est toujours aussi actuel et c'est un document précieux pour tous les psychologues et les éducateurs soucieux de connaître les liens qui unissent l'acquisition du langage au développement de la raison. A partir d'observations du langage spontané d'enfants de 4 à 8 ans, l'auteur a saisi le noyau fonctionnel de la connaissance qui soutend le langage des petits, l'égocentrisme de leur pensée. C'est cet égocentrisme qui expliquerait la difficulté du jeune enfant à différencier son point de vue propre de celui de son interlocuteur. L'auteur montre également comment, au cours de son développement, l'enfant parvient progressivement à se situer dans la perspective d'autrui et à organiser son discours en fonction de son partenaire.},

We also revisit and review the multi-disciplinary terminology and discuss the main conceptual dualities characterizing creativity. Our major contribution is at the level of brain processes in creative problem solving (CPS), providing a bridge into the learning sciences and creativity research to better understand the neurosciences of creativitywhat happens in our brain during CPScreative problem-solving tasks. This fundamental research review can shed light on the inner mechanisms of creativity and provide a more informed understanding of creative problem solving as a dynamic process thanks to a computational model of creativity.},

The “revolution” was often slow and piecemeal, as illustrated by four conferences held between 1955 and 1966 in the field of memory.

Instead of debating the amount of time that should be spent in school (and on schoolwork), this article addresses how the available instructional time might be optimally utilized via the scheduling of review or practice. Hundreds of studies in cognitive and educational psychology have demonstrated that spacing out repeated encounters with the material over time produces superior long-term learning, compared with repetitions that are massed together. Also, incorporating tests into spaced practice amplifies the benefits. Spaced review or practice enhances diverse forms of learning, including memory, problem solving, and generalization to new situations. Spaced practice is a feasible and cost-effective way to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of learning, and has tremendous potential to improve educational outcomes. The article also discusses barriers to adopting spaced practice, recent developments, and their possible implications.},

Repeated stimuli separated by timed spaces without stimuli can initiate Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) and long-term memory (LTM) encoding. These processes occur in time scales of minutes, and have been demonstrated in many species. This study reports on using a specific timed pattern of three repeated stimuli separated by 10 min spaces drawn from both behavioral and laboratory studies of LTP and LTM encoding. A technique was developed based on this pattern to test whether encoding complex information into LTM in students was possible using the pattern within a very short time scale. In an educational context, stimuli were periods of highly compressed instruction, and spaces were created through 10 min distractor activities. Spaced Learning in this form was used as the only means of instruction for a national curriculum Biology course, and led to very rapid LTM encoding as measured by the high-stakes test for the course. Remarkably, learning at a greatly increased speed and in a pattern that included deliberate distraction produced significantly higher scores than random answers (p {\textless} 0.00001) and scores were not significantly different for experimental groups (one hour spaced learning) and control groups (four months teaching). Thus learning per hour of instruction, as measured by the test, was significantly higher for the spaced learning groups (p {\textless} 0.00001). In a third condition, spaced learning was used to replace the end of course review for one of two examinations. Results showed significantly higher outcomes for the course using spaced learning (p {\textless} 0.0005). The implications of these findings and further areas for research are briefly considered.},

In particular, our large brains and increased intelligence may be partly independent of our ape phylogeny and the result of convergent processes similar to those that have molded avian and platyrrhine intelligence. Tool use, innovativeness and cultural transmission might be linked over our past and in our brains as operations of domain-general intelligence. Finally, colonization of new areas may have accompanied increases in both brain size and innovativeness in hominins as they have in other mammals and in birds, potentially accelerating hominin evolution via behavioral drive.},

Yet, many students struggle to anticipate learning difficulties and adjust accordingly. Further, despite theorizing that self-regulated learning involves adaptation across learning cycles, few researchers have examined students’ evaluative judgments, their implications for students’ behavior in a subsequent learning cycle, or their effects on achievement. Utilizing data from a large, introductory college biology course, we examined how struggling students’ evaluative judgments made after a first unit exam predicted changes in learning behaviors as well as how those changes predicted performance on a subsequent exam. We used natural language processing to analyze data from a reflective essay written after a first unit exam, identifying language that reflected evaluation of prior studying and plans to adapt learning. Then, we utilized digital traces of learning behaviors to measure students’ actual adaptation of their use of learning resources. Results from a path analysis revealed students’ evaluations predicted how extensively they discussed plans to adapt their learning process. Plans to adapt described in written reflections predicted an increase in the frequency of desirable learning behaviors, which in turn predicted higher subsequent exam scores, after controlling for previous exam performance. These findings provide empirical evidence of multiple theorized self-regulated learning processes, including how evaluations of learning at the end of a learning cycle can inform planning and behavior changes in a subsequent learning cycle, and that increases in the enactment of effective learning strategies predict improved performance in complex learning tasks.},

	doi = {10.31234/osf.io/4cbuv},
	abstract = {The idea that human cognition is, or can be understood as, a form of computation is a useful conceptual tool for cognitive science. It was a foundational assumption during the birth of cognitive science as a multidisciplinary field, with Artificial Intelligence (AI) as one of its contributing fields. One conception of AI in this context is as a provider of computational tools (frameworks, concepts, formalisms, models, proofs, simulations, etc.) that support theory building in cognitive science. The contemporary field of AI, however, has taken the theoretical possibility of explaining human cognition as a form of computation to imply the practical feasibility of realising human(-like or -level) cognition in factual computational systems; and, the field frames this realisation as a short-term inevitability. Yet, as we formally prove herein, creating systems with human(-like or -level) cognition is intrinsically computationally intractable. This means that any factual AI systems created in the short-run are at best decoys. When we think these systems capture something deep about ourselves and our thinking, we induce distorted and impoverished images of ourselves and our cognition. In other words, AI in current practice is deteriorating our theoretical understanding of cognition rather than advancing and enhancing it. The situation could be remediated by releasing the grip of the currently dominant view on AI and by returning to the idea of AI as a theoretical tool for cognitive science. In reclaiming this older idea of AI, however, it is important not to repeat conceptual mistakes of the past (and present) that brought us to where we are today.},

	abstract = {Humans spend a lifetime learning, storing and refining a repertoire of motor memories. For example, through experience, we become proficient at manipulating a large range of objects with distinct dynamical properties. However, it is unknown what principle underlies how our continuous stream of sensorimotor experience is segmented into separate memories and how we adapt and use this growing repertoire. Here we develop a theory of motor learning based on the key principle that memory creation, updating and expression are all controlled by a single computation—contextual inference. Our theory reveals that adaptation can arise both by creating and updating memories (proper learning) and by changing how existing memories are differentially expressed (apparent learning). This insight enables us to account for key features of motor learning that had no unified explanation: spontaneous recovery1, savings2, anterograde interference3, how environmental consistency affects learning rate4,5 and the distinction between explicit and implicit learning6. Critically, our theory also predicts new phenomena—evoked recovery and context-dependent single-trial learning—which we confirm experimentally. These results suggest that contextual inference, rather than classical single-context mechanisms1,4,7–9, is the key principle underlying how a diverse set of experiences is reflected in our motor behaviour. A theory of motor learning based on the principle of contextual inference reveals that adaptation can arise by both creating and updating memories and changing how existing memories are differentially expressed, and predicts evoked recovery and context-dependent single-trial learning.},

The judgments of education "experts" frequently appear to be unconstrained and sometimes altogether unaffected by objective research. The first section of this essay provides examples from reading and mathematics curricula that show experts dispensing unproven methods and flitting from one fad to another. The middle section describes how experts, for ideological reasons, have shunned some solutions that do display robust evidence of  efficacy. The following sections show how public impatience has forced other professions to "grow up" and accept accountability and scientific evidence.

We take one set of analogy problems used to evaluate LLMs and create a set of “counterfactual” variants—versions that test the same abstract reasoning abilities but that are likely dissimilar from any pre-training data. We test humans and three GPT models on both the original and counterfactual problems, and show that, while the performance of humans remains high for all the problems, the GPT models’ performance declines sharply on the counterfactual set. This work provides evidence that, despite previously reported successes of LLMs on analogical reasoning, these models lack the robustness and generality of human analogy-making.},

	abstract = {Many statistical problems involve the estimation of a \$\${\textbackslash}left( d{\textbackslash}times d{\textbackslash}right) \$\$orthogonal matrix \$\${\textbackslash}varvec\{Q\}\$\$. Such an estimation is often challenging due to the orthonormality constraints on \$\${\textbackslash}varvec\{Q\}\$\$. To cope with this problem, we use the well-known PLU decomposition, which factorizes any invertible \$\${\textbackslash}left( d{\textbackslash}times d{\textbackslash}right) \$\$matrix as the product of a \$\${\textbackslash}left( d{\textbackslash}times d{\textbackslash}right) \$\$permutation matrix \$\${\textbackslash}varvec\{P\}\$\$, a \$\${\textbackslash}left( d{\textbackslash}times d{\textbackslash}right) \$\$unit lower triangular matrix \$\${\textbackslash}varvec\{L\}\$\$, and a \$\${\textbackslash}left( d{\textbackslash}times d{\textbackslash}right) \$\$upper triangular matrix \$\${\textbackslash}varvec\{U\}\$\$. Thanks to the QR decomposition, we find the formulation of \$\${\textbackslash}varvec\{U\}\$\$when the PLU decomposition is applied to \$\${\textbackslash}varvec\{Q\}\$\$. We call the result as PLR decomposition; it produces a one-to-one correspondence between \$\${\textbackslash}varvec\{Q\}\$\$and the \$\$d{\textbackslash}left( d-1{\textbackslash}right) /2\$\$entries below the diagonal of \$\${\textbackslash}varvec\{L\}\$\$, which are advantageously unconstrained real values. Thus, once the decomposition is applied, regardless of the objective function under consideration, we can use any classical unconstrained optimization method to find the minimum (or maximum) of the objective function with respect to \$\${\textbackslash}varvec\{L\}\$\$. For illustrative purposes, we apply the PLR decomposition in common principle components analysis (CPCA) for the maximum likelihood estimation of the common orthogonal matrix when a multivariate leptokurtic-normal distribution is assumed in each group. Compared to the commonly used normal distribution, the leptokurtic-normal has an additional parameter governing the excess kurtosis; this makes the estimation of \$\${\textbackslash}varvec\{Q\}\$\$in CPCA more robust against mild outliers. The usefulness of the PLR decomposition in leptokurtic-normal CPCA is illustrated by two biometric data analyses.},

As a promising mitigation, the Low-Dimensional Computing (LDC) method significantly reduces the vector dimension by {\textasciitilde}100 times while maintaining accuracy, by employing a gradient-based optimization. Despite its potential, LDC optimization for VSA is still underexplored. Our investigation into vector updates underscores the importance of stable, adaptive dynamics in LDC training. We also reveal the overlooked yet critical roles of batch normalization (BN) and knowledge distillation (KD) in standard approaches. Besides the accuracy boost, BN does not add computational overhead during inference, and KD significantly enhances inference confidence. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies across multiple benchmarks, we provide a thorough evaluation of our approach and extend the interpretability of binary neural network optimization similar to LDC, previously unaddressed in BNN literature.},

	abstract = {Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in recent years. Central to its success is its ability to learn representations that preserve task-relevant structure. However, massive energy, compute, and data costs are required to learn general representations. This paper explores Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), a computationally and data-efficient brain-inspired alternative. HDC acts as a bridge between connectionist and symbolic approaches to artificial intelligence (AI), allowing explicit specification of representational structure as in symbolic approaches while retaining the flexibility of connectionist approaches. However, HDC's simplicity poses challenges for encoding complex compositional structures, especially in its binding operation. To address this, we propose Generalized Holographic Reduced Representations (GHRR), an extension of Fourier Holographic Reduced Representations (FHRR), a specific HDC implementation. GHRR introduces a flexible, non-commutative binding operation, enabling improved encoding of complex data structures while preserving HDC's desirable properties of robustness and transparency. In this work, we introduce the GHRR framework, prove its theoretical properties and its adherence to HDC properties, explore its kernel and binding characteristics, and perform empirical experiments showcasing its flexible non-commutativity, enhanced decoding accuracy for compositional structures, and improved memorization capacity compared to FHRR.},

This has been explained using symbolic and connectionist approaches, inspiring the development of a neuro-symbolic architecture that combines both paradigms. In parallel, recent studies have proposed the use of a "relational bottleneck" that separates object-level features from abstract rules, allowing learning from limited amounts of data . While powerful, it is vulnerable to the curse of compositionality meaning that object representations with similar features tend to interfere with each other. In this paper, we leverage hyperdimensional computing, which is inherently robust to such interference to build a compositional architecture. We adapt the "relational bottleneck" strategy to a high-dimensional space, incorporating explicit vector binding operations between symbols and relational representations. Additionally, we design a novel high-dimensional attention mechanism that leverages this relational representation. Our system benefits from the low overhead of operations in hyperdimensional space, making it significantly more efficient than the state of the art when evaluated on a variety of test datasets, while maintaining higher or equal accuracy.},

Here, we discuss why vector-based representations provide a compelling account that can meet all these needs while being plausibly encoded into neural architectures.

	abstract = {Viral species classification is crucial for understanding viral evolution, epidemiology, and developing effective diagnostics and treatments. Traditional methods often rely on sequence similarity, which can be challenging for rapidly evolving viruses. Pangenomes, offering a comprehensive representation of species’ genomic diversity, provide a richer perspective, but their analysis often requires advanced computational methods. We investigate the use of Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), also known as Vector-Symbolic Architecture (VSA), an emerging computing paradigm that relies on vectors in high-dimensional spaces to encode a multi-species viral pangenome.
We develop a new method for encoding graph-structured viral pangenomes using high-dimensional vectors. Pangenomes are represented as weighted de Bruijn graphs constructed using sequences of consecutive k-mers from the genomes, while information about the genome species (their class) is encoded as specific weights on the edges of the graph. The weighted de Bruijn graph representation is encoded into a single high-dimensional vector. We tested three classification strategies: a flat model at the species level, a flat model at the genus level, and a two-step hierarchical model.
We applied our method to a pangenome comprising 542 viral species from NCBI GenBank. Our results reveal a complex relationship between model architecture and classification accuracy. The flat species-level model achieved the highest accuracy, correctly classifying 87.08\% of test genomes. Counter-intuitively, simplifying the problem to the genus level or using a hierarchical approach degraded performance, with accuracies dropping to 60.51\% and 33.57\% respectively. These outcomes highlight critical challenges in alignment-free classification, such as signal dilution in overly broad taxonomic groups and error propagation in multi-step models. The model’s reconstruction rate proved to be a reliable measure of confidence, rather than a direct predictor of correctness.
This novel approach offers a promising new direction for viral classification, not only for its predictive power but its ability to reveal underlying challenges in genomic taxonomy.},

On the perceptual side, we propose that shape perception in humans involves searching for the shortest program that correctly draws the image (program induction). A consequence of this framework is that the mental difficulty of remembering a shape should depend on its minimum description length (MDL) in the proposed language. In two experiments, we show that encoding and processing of geometric shapes is well predicted by MDL.

Peirce’s pragmatic maxim entails that the consequences of a sign inform our entire conception of the sign, while his most considered semiotic system entails that a complex sign partakes of iconic, indexical, and symbolic aspects. We illustrate Peirce’s insights by means of the celebrated Feynman Diagrams in Quantum Electrodynamics. We argue that Peirce’s late, post-1903, semiotics provides an adequate characterization of such “hypoicons,” and his pragmatic maxim explains how they can motivate and drive inquiry. We conclude that Peirce’s pragmatic approach to scientific diagrams remains a viable position that skillfully avoids dogmatic scientism and nihilistic skepticism alike.},
